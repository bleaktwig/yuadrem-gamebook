\subsection*{Appendix 1: Unit Conversions} \label{ssec::unitconversions}
As you probably realized, this book uses the metric system instead of freedom units.
If you want to use official or custom content for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition in Yuadrem or (god forbid) use the content in this book in imperial units, use this table for conversions:

\begin{DndTable}[width=\linewidth, header=Standard Conversion]{lX}
    \textbf{Imperial} & \textbf{``Metric''} \\
    1 inch            &    2.5 cm           \\
    1 foot            &   20 cm             \\
    5 feet            &    1 meter          \\
    10 feet           &    2 meters         \\
    30 feet           &    6 meters         \\
    10,000 feet       &    2 km             \\
    1 pound           &    0.5 kg           \\
    20 pounds         &   10 kg             \\
    1 mile            &    1.5 km           \\
    1000 miles        & 1500 km
\end{DndTable}

While this conversion is not exact, it is good enough and manages to keep simplicity in the author's opinion.

Travelling distances consider 8 hours of walking, and are:
\subparagraph{Fast pace} You walk 120 meters per minute, and 50 km per day.
\subparagraph{Normal pace} You walk 90 meters per minute, and 40 km per day.
\subparagraph{Slow pace} You walk 60 meters per minute, and 30 km per day.

For improved simplicity in combat, one square in the battle map (normally 5 by 5 feet) measures 1 by 1 meter.
While this may make conversion from common D\&D somewhat weird, it makes calculating distances much easier in combat.
