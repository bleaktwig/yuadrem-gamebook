\chapter{Mechanic Changes}
\DndDropCapLine{S}{trands may break alone, but twisted}
\textit{make a braid.
Together on their own, the journey shall be made.}

\hspace*{\fill} --- Anonymous song.

This book includes major mechanical changes.
These mostly focus on allowing players to embrace the worldbuilding aspects of Yuadrem by freeing up their character building options.
These changes are of course optional, but most of the rules in the book were designed with them in mind.

Then, optional rules are included.
Yuadrem is a harsh continent, and these rules help set the atmosphere to reflect this.
They are completely optional, and a healthy gaming table should discuss which should be included or excluded in their game.

\begin{DndComment}[float=h]{Help Wanted!}
    This entire book was designed with the major mechanical changes considered, yet the author realizes that this can alienate a large part of the community.
    You may want to play in Yuadrem without these changes.
    If this is the case, many other mechanics need to be changed accordingly to acommodate this.

    If for some insane reason you want to take on this challenge, you are encouraged to contact the book's author.
    We could work together on this, discussing appropiate retribution and co-authorship terms.

\section{Classless D\&D}

% \section{Dementia}
% \DndDropCapLine{H}{arsh is the process that awaits the}
% foolish or unlucky enough to lose their qualar.
% Their sentience slips away slowly as they lose their mental capacities.
% Perhaps the worst part is that inward awareness is one of the last attributes lost, forcing them to be fully conscious of the process.
%
% The road towards dementia comes in seven stages, each roughly lasting a week.
% At the moment when you lose your qualar, you enter the first stage of dementia.
% After a week, you roll a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw.
% On a fail, you enter the next stage of dementia.
% On a success, you stay on your current stage and roll again at the start of the next week.
% Dementia is unavoidable, and the DC increases by 1 after every successful roll.
%
% \subsubsection{First Stage}
% No obvious signs of dementia, only minor short-memory loss occurs.
% The main symptoms are associated to the anxiety from the loss of the qualar.
% You start focusing more on your past, often drifting away into daydreams.
%
% You suffer the following effects:
% \subparagraph{Decreased Awareness} You roll for initiative and Dexterity saving throws with disadvantage.
% \subparagraph{Restlessness} Roll an DC 12 intelligence saving throw right after a short rest.
% On a success, you recover your hit points normally.
% On a failure, you only recover half of the hit dice rolled (rounded down).
%
% \subsubsection{Second Stage}
% The self realization and awareness that something is wrong settles in.
% You refuse to accept that your mind is slipping away.
% The more effort you put on remembering the more deterioration your memory suffers.
% Confusion starts setting in.
%
% In addition to the effects of the first stage, you suffer the following effects:
% \subparagraph{Lack of Recollection} Any ability check made to remember or recollect a memory is done with disadvantage.
% All Intelligence (History) checks are made with disadvantage.
% \subparagraph{Mood Swings} All Charisma ability checks and saving throws are made with disadvantage.
%
% \subsubsection{Third Stage}
% You experience increased forgetfulness and might find concentrating difficult.
% You are presented with some of the last coherent memories before confusion fully rolls in.
% Some singular memories become more disturbed, isolated, broken, and distant.
% These are the last embers of awareness.
%
% In addition to the effects of the last stages, you suffer the following effects:
% \subparagraph{Decreased Concentration} All Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration are made with disadvantage.
% \subparagraph{Vagrant Mind} Intelligence and Wisdom ability checks and saving throws are rolled with disadvantage.
%
% \subsubsection{Fourth Stage}
% Grey mists form and fade away in your memory.
% The ability to recall singular memories gives way to confusion and horror.
% You struggle with daily tasks, presenting clear cognitive problems.
%
% In addition to the effects of the last stages, you suffer the following effects:
% \subparagraph{Motor Difficulties} Strength and Dexterity ability checks and saving throws are rolled with disadvantage.
% Attack rolls are made with disadvantage.
% \subparagraph{Drifting Conscience} In combat, roll a DC 8 Intelligence saving throw at the start of every turn.
% On a failure, you forget where you are, and cannot take any actions during the turn.
%
% \subsubsection{Fifth Stage}
% You have major memory deficiencies.
% The few lapses of consciousness you get are filled with dread, as you realize your mind has mostly left you.
% The repetition and rupture gives way to calmer moments, as the unfamiliar becomes familiar.
%
% In addition to the effects of the last stages, you suffer the following effects:
% \subparagraph{Loss of Fortitude} All rolls are made with disadvantage.
% \subparagraph{Complete Unawareness} All Intelligence (Investigation), Wisdom (Insight), and Wisdom (Perception) automatically fail.
% Your passive investigation, insight, and perception become 0.
%
% \subsubsection{Sixth Stage}
% Your mental state is beyond description.
% You struggle to remember your early life, even forgetting the names of your family and fellows.
% Your capacity of speech is severely impaired, and you suffer sudden and radical personality and emotional changes.
%
% In addition to the effects of the last stages, you suffer the following effects:
% \subparagraph{Declining Speech} You automatically fail all Charisma ability checks and saving throws, and have a very hard time communicating verbally.
% \subparagraph{Hope Lost} As your conscious mind fights your natural tendencies, you automatically fail death saving throws.
%
% \subsubsection{Final Stage}
% Everywhere, an empty bliss.
%
% You make what will most likely be your last die roll, this time with no disadvantage.
% Roll a d20 on the post-dementia table.
% You suffer the effect rolled.
%
% \begin{DndTable}[width=\linewidth, header=Post-dementia Effects]{lX}
%     \textbf{Roll} & \textbf{Effect} \\
%     1 & Your last emotion is rage. You become mindless and violent, attacking your companions without reason. \\
%     2-5 & Your last emotion is apathy. You endlessly stare at the east until you die of natural causes. \\
%     6-18 & Even after brain death, you seek survival. You wander off, attacking any who try to stop you. You become a lost one. \\
%     19 & With memories gone, your mind is fully pulled by its tidal impulses. You lose control of your character, who becomes a servant of The Sorrow. \\
%     20 & Go back to the first stage of dementia, and gain a rank in the Dementia Insight heroic feat.
% \end{DndTable}
%
% The only conventional way to remove dementia is to obtain a qualar again.
% When this happens, you go back one stage of dementia per day passed.
% While in this state you suffer a terrible fever.
% At the beginning of each day roll a Constitution saving throw.
% On a failure, you gain one level of exhaustion.

%
% \subsection*{Only One Chance}
% As a rule, you only have one chance to succeed in any action.
% Once you have rolled the dice, you many not roll again to achieve the same goal.
% You need to try something different or wait until the circumstances have changed in a substantial way.
% Or let another PC try.
%
% This rule does not apply to combat, where you can attack the same enemy until it becomes a bloody pulp.
%
% \subsubsection*{Opportunity Attacks} \label{rule::opportunityattacks}
% In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies to drop their guard.
% While heedless movement is easily punished, any lack of concentration or unplanned action can have devastating consequences.
% Various actions provoke opportunity attacks from a creature:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Moving out of the creature's reach.
%     This doesn't apply when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction.
%     \item Picking up an item from the floor while in the creature's reach.
%     \item Unsheathing a weapon while in the creature's reach.
%     \item Donning or doffing a shield while in the creature's reach.
%     \item Using the Attack action with a ranged weapon in a creature's reach.
% \end{itemize}
% You can avoid opportunity attacks during your turn by taking the Disengage action.
