\subsection*{Only One Chance} \label{ssec::onlyonechance}
    As a rule, you only have one chance to succeed in any action.
    Once you have rolled the dice, you many not roll again to achieve the same goal.
    You need to try something different or wait until the circumstances have changed in a substantial way.
    Or, you know, let another PC try.

    This rule does not apply to combat, where you can attack the same enemy until it becomes a bloody pulp.

\subsubsection*{Opportunity Attacks} \label{rule::opportunityattacks}
    In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies to drop their guard.
    While heedless movement is easily punished, any lack of concentration or unplanned action can have devastating consequences.
    Various actions provoke opportunity attacks from a creature:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Moving out of the creature's reach.
        This doesn't apply when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction.
        \item Picking up an item from the floor while in the creature's reach.
        \item Unsheathing a weapon while in the creature's reach.
        \item Donning or doffing a shield while in the creature's reach.
        \item Using the Attack action with a ranged weapon in a creature's reach.
    \end{itemize}
    You can avoid opportunity attacks during your turn by taking the Disengage action.
