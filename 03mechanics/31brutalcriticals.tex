\subsection*{Brutal Criticals} \label{ssec::brutalcriticals}

Presented here are optional rules that expand the scope of critical hits.
Introducing a series of critical hit charts that vary based on the damage type of the attack, this module adds an additional element of uncertainty, suspense, and surprise to combat.

\subsubsection{Revisions to Critical Hits}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item When you land a critical hit on a creature, roll the damage dice twice and add them together as normal.
        Then, roll a d20 and use the corresponding result on the critical hit chart determined by the damage type of your attack.
        \item When you score a critical hit with an attack that does two or more types of damage, choose one of those damage types and roll on that critical chart.
        \item Traits and feats like Savage Attacks and Brutal Critical continue to work as written.
    \end{itemize}
