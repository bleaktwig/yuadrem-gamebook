\section*{Classless D\&D} \label{sec::classlessdnd}

Due to the major differences in both style and setting between Yuadrem and other D\&D settings, most classes don't fit very well into it.
Instead of designing new classes, a classless system is introduced.
This system is inspired by many different, well-tested sources (Credits in addenda).

The details of this system are described in detail in its own chaper at page \pageref{ch::classlessdnd}.
