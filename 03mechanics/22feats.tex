\subsection*{Feats} \label{ssec::feats}
For simplicity, feats are separated into six categories: feats related to kin, background, skills, proficiencies, combat, and spellcasting.
Kin, background, proficiencies, and spellcasting feats are detailed in their corresponding chapters, while skills and combat feats are described in this section.
In addition, lists with all the feats are contained in the following pages.

Unless specified otherwise, a feat can only be learned once.
