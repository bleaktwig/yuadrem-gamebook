\section{Optional Rules} \label{sec::optionalrules}
\subsection*{Equipment Properties} \label{ssec::equipmentproperties1}
    Apart from their weight class, armors have specific properties.
    These carry with them beneficial and detrimental effects.
    Additionally, some feats have effects that apply to armor with certain properties, or are restricted by them.

    As usual, weapons also have properties.
    A small amount of new properties are added to the ones in the PHB.

    A list of the different armor properties is included in the equipment chapter (see page \pageref{ssec::armorproperties}).

\subsection*{Flaws} \label{ssec::flaws}
    As you travel through treacherous lands and fight dangerous creatures, it is natural to acquire permanent wounds or fears.
    These new flaws don't need to be entirely bad --- they reflect a changing point in your life, and can be beneficial in their own way.

    When you suffer a major injury, fear, or insanity, you can choose to accept this effect as a flaw.
    When you do so, it becomes permanent.
    For example, a crippled arm might need to be severed off, or your character might get used to their insanity and learn to live with it instead of treating it.

    While this effect may prove as a permanent hindrance to you, you are rewarded with FP for taking it.
    This extra FP does not count towards your number of hit dice.
    The number of FP awarded by effects is specified in the effect's description.

% \subsection*{Hunger and Thirst} \label{ssec::hungerandthirst}
%     \textbf{TODO.}
% NOTE: We can stay with vanilla's system, it's good enough tbh.

\subsection*{Injuries \& Insanity} \label{ssec::injuriesandinsanity}
    Critical hits or especially severe events can cause injuries or insanity.
    When a creature suffers a minor injury it can be healed by someone competent with a healer's kit over the course of a long rest.
    Major injuries and Insanities require assistance from a dedicated healer, or someone with the relevant feat (see page \pageref{feat::physician} and \pageref{feat::therapist}).

    Alternatively, you can decide to keep an injury or insanity as a new Flaw (see page \pageref{ssec::flaws}) during a short rest after it is applied.
    Minor injuries and insanities award you 2 FP, while major injuries award you 3 FP.
    Acquiring a flaw from a major injury related to a minor injury you already have (such as Crippled Leg and Injured Leg) only awards 1 FP --- one more than what you already had gained.
    % The text of certain injuries will specify other ways this injuries might resolve.

\subsection*{Only One Chance} \label{ssec::onlyonechance}
    As a rule, you only have one chance to succeed in any action.
    Once you have rolled the dice, you many not roll again to achieve the same goal.
    You need to try something different or wait until the circumstances have changed in a substantial way.
    Or, you know, let another PC try.

    This rule does not apply to combat, where you can attack the same enemy until it becomes a bloody pulp.

\subsection*{Opportunity Attacks} \label{rule::opportunityattacks}
    In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies to drop their guard.
    While heedless movement is easily punished, any lack of concentration or unplanned action can have devastating consequences.
    Various actions provoke opportunity attacks from a creature:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Moving out of the creature's reach.
        This doesn't apply when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction.

        \newpage

        \item Picking up an item from the floor while in the creature's reach.
        \item Unsheathing a weapon while in the creature's reach.
        \item Donning or doffing a shield while in the creature's reach.
        \item Using the Attack action with a ranged weapon or spell attack in a creature's reach.
    \end{itemize}
    You can avoid opportunity attacks during your turn by taking the Disengage action.

\subsection*{Short and Long Rests} \label{ssec::shortandlongrests}
    The gritty campaigns in Yuadrem benefit from longer rest times.
    Short rests last for 8 hours, and long rests for 6 days --- a week in the Fagalian calendar.
    This puts the brakes on the campaign, requiring the players to carefully judge the benefits and drawbacks of combat.
    Characters can't afford to engage in too many battles in a row, and all adventuring requires careful planning.

    Complementing this optional rule is the fact that all spell slots are recovered during short rests.
    Additionally, all the systems in this book are designed with this optional rule in mind, so some things need to be re-balanced if a group is to play without this rule.

    \begin{table*}[h]
        \begin{DndTable}[width=\linewidth, header=Insanity]{cX}
            \textbf{d20} & \textbf{Insanity} \\

            2  & \textbf{Kleptomania}.

            4  & \textbf{Obsession}.
            Choose a person or personal interest you are obsessed with.

            5  & \textbf{Addiction}.

            6  & \textbf{Odd Thinking}.
            Once per day when you hear a rational explanation for an event or occurrence, your DM may call on you to succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 12) or you reject the rational explanation for a conspiratorial or fantastical explanation. \\
            7  & \textbf{Narcissism}.

            8  & \textbf{Delusional}.
            When you gain this insanity the DM will tell you a belief that you have. No matter what evidence is presented to the contrary so long as you have this insanity you cannot be persuaded that this belief is not true. \\
            9  & \textbf{Pica}.
            Once per day the DM can call on you to pass a Wisdom saving throw (DC 14) or immediately eat one non-food object (such as dirt, napkins, or a small piece of jewelry) of the DM’s choice. \\
            10 & \textbf{Retrograde amnesia}.
            You forget everything about your personal life prior to the moment you received this insanity. \\
            11 & \textbf{Overwhelmed}.
            If you do not have immunity or resistance to psychic damage, you gain vulnerability to psychic damage.
            If you have resistance to psychic damage, you lose it.
            If you have immunity to psychic damage, you lose it but gain resistance to psychic damage. \\

        \end{DndTable}
    \end{table*}

\subsection*{Stress} \label{ssec::stress}
    Adventuring is dangerous, and no matter the amount of heroic deeds in your past you are bound to accumulate stress over time.
    As a mechanic, stress adds long-term consequences to traumatic experiences and tense situations.

    Whenever you drop to 0 hit points, add a point to your stress meter.
    % Some specific attacks directly produce stress on a creature.
    When you reach 4 stress points, you roll on the Afflictions table and acquire the specified affliction, reducing your stress meter back to 2.
    % Afflictions are detrimental conditions that have short or long-term consequences for you.

    Taking a long rest or engaging in downtime activities reduces your stress meter by 1.
    Additionally, some feats like \pageref{feat::entertainer} and \pageref{feat::reliever} add the capacity to reduce stress in different scenarios.

    \newpage~\newpage~\newpage

    \begin{table*}[t]
    \begin{DndTable}[width=\linewidth, header=Affliction]{cX}
        \textbf{d20} & \textbf{Affliction} \\

        2-5   & \textbf{Phobia}.
        Powerless at the face of death, you can only watch as your foe strikes its final blow against you.
        You add to your flaws the phobia of the type of creature who put you unconscious.
        Any time you encounter this type of creature, roll a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw at the beginning of each of your turns.
        On a failure, you become frightened of the creature.
        This flaw is permanent, and awards you 1 FP. \\
        6-7   & \textbf{Fearful}.
        % Scared of death, you become fearful and meek.
        Whenever you take damage, roll a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw.

        This effect lasts until you finish a short rest. \\
        8-9   & \textbf{Paranoid}.

        You cannot heal or aid an ally in any way, and you refuse to receive any healing or aid from any creature.
        This effect lasts until you finish a short rest. \\
        16-17 & \textbf{Hopeless}.
        Attacks against you are made with advantage, and you roll saving throws with disadvantage.
        This effect lasts until you finish a short rest. \\
        18-19 & \textbf{Irrational}.
