\section{Background}

For your character's background, you can choose any from some of the official D\&D5e books which fit best with your character.
The specific books from which you are welcome to pick a background are Acquisitions Incorporated, Ghosts of Saltmarsh, the Player's Handbook, Mythic Odysseys of Theros, and Tomb of Annihilation.

The only change you need to apply is to convert any initial money to the local currency of the region where you're playing.
To do this, convert the GP to the local currency using the currencies table in page \pageref{sec::currency} using the selling value.

To choose religions and learned languages, refer to their respective sections in pages \pageref{ssec::religions} and \pageref{ssec::languages}.
