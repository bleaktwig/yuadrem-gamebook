sorts of climates and biomes, Yuadrem is a supercontinent of impressive variety.
Many creatures of many natures interact with one another in its grounds, creating complex and diverse ecosystems and cultures.

Before any creature lived on the planet, the continent rose from the deepest of waters and established itself as a land amidst four violent seas.
It later became the cradle of civilization.
No matter how much change its inhabitants suffer, Yuadrem continues to stand as a testimony of the resilience of the ground, impervious to the business of its dwellers.

To distinguish its territories, Yuadrem is commonly divided into six regions: The Northern Territories, the Three Deserts, the Whaler's Sea, the Beryl Sea, the Barbaric Territories, and the Wildlands.
