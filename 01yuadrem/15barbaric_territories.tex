\subsection*{Barbaric Territories} \label{ssec::barbaricterritories}

To the east of Yuadrem are the Barbaric Territories, a region defined by the brutality of war and the greed of an empire.
From north to south, the land can be divided into five areas, each with its own distinct characteristics: the Drylands, Cabb Goem-Rlamesh, the Shield Sea, the Chirping Wilds, and the Xuam Peninsula.

% Drylands
Northernmost are the Drylands, a field devoid of trees or any sort of tall flora.
The area is plain and parched, dried over the years for its lack of rains or rivers.
The northernmost area of the savanna remains bare to date, and is the most tortuous stretch between the Fesh Peninsula and the southern nations.

% Mzavit river and southern savanna
Down across the Mzavit River, the savanna becomes humid and with this water comes civilization.
A wide array of gat city-states have been established here.
Able to withstand the thunderous force of the Jenkashian and Iskenese armies and the hulking chimeras from the Next, these states are noteworthy for their fortitude.
Of special note is the adamant country of Byurev, who have halted the growth of Isken for almost three centuries.

% Cabb Goem-Rlamesh
% NOTE. In the whole island of Cabb Goem-Rlamesh a faint crying sound can be heard.
Off the coast of the Drylands lies a place known as the breathing island, Cabb Goem-Rlamesh.
A harrowing immensity, the landmass is constructed entirely of flesh and bone, and is believed to be what remains of the ets.
Not much is known about the island, and none of the few explorers who have traveled to it retain their sanity.
The mad tell tales of a mortifying city of flesh, and of strange, shape-shifting inhabitants.

% Shield Sea & The Nest
% Wrong information - geomancy was invented by an ancient civilization that warred with the tall kin eons ago, but was erased from history by the victors. There are ruins from this civilization at the basin of the lake, and Fo is the last remaining member from it.
Southwest of the Drylands rest the Shield Sea, an enormous body of water fed by a wide array of tributaries from the Forking Peaks.
In antiquity, the ruined ird civilization of Hairuus invented the art of geomancy in its coasts, raising from the basin the island of ``The Nest'' at its center.
The island currently hosts only one being, Fo.
Fo is a strange creature, rumored to be out of this world.
It welcomes visitors with a variety of fierce chimeras.

% Chirping Wilds
Southeast from the Drylands and passing through the Do Nana swamp are the Chirping Wilds, a vast and largely untamed rainforest.
The jungle is inhabited only by the Iskenese empire, a large grung nation that expelled the original ird and marset population.
The only territories currently not held by the grungs' military might are the strong qulbaba irds of Harual to the west, and the marsets of Uzuz from the Xuam peninsula.

The Xuam Peninsula is the southermost point of the Barbaric Territories, and is located just south of the Grasping Gulf.
The region has facilitated the development of Uzuz due to the heavy presence of wurmroot, a white-leaf poplar tree that is conveniently toxic to all foreigner kins, specially to grungs.
