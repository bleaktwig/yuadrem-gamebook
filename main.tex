% NOTE. Current year: 673 AS.
% NOTE. LEAVE METALLURGY AS AN ANCIENT ART THAT SPARKED AMONG THE MODERN CIVILIZATIONS FROM ANCIENT AF WALL CARVINGS FOUND IN CAVERNS BELOW KRUDZAL.
% NOTE. THERE ARE COLOSSAL ARMS PUSHING CABB-GOEM RLAMESH OUT OF THE OCEAN. THESE ARE THE HIGHER KIN, FORBIDDING THE TALL KIN PASSAGE INTO THEIR DOMAINS.
% NOTE. SOUTH OF BYUREV THERE'S A LONG LINE OF MISSING VEGETATION - THEY CUT A TON OF TREES IN PREPARATION OF ISKEN'S INVASION.
% NOTE. Hulnar's long lineage of kings supposedly came from the tall kin, and are named using jantherlin names.
% NOTE. After the schism, many of the peoples from the immigrant kins couldn't find qualia, and each of the three species were divided into two, the "normal" ones and the lost ones:
%   * umans - boggarts and frostburned
%   * tortles - ???
%   * grungs - slaadi
% NOTE. Tortle and grung blood work for spellcasting just as umans blood, but it is much less effective. Blood sold by umans that travel with grungs and tortles tends to have lower values due to this.
% NOTE. Fucking penguins as a subrace sounds pretty interesting.
% NOTE. qulbaba irds hate marsets because the latter was created to fulfill the task that the former failed in.
% NOTE. special trees grow in areas from the southern ocean with VERY curved trunks, with other flora being very close to the ground.
% NOTE. Huathem: a set of cards used for reading the future, similar to tarot. There are 16 major cards and 40 minor cards (1 to 8 for each tide). The cards were created by the Zaloth.
