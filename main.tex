    % TODO: UPDATE MAP:
    % ADD THE MISSING NAMES TO THE GLOBE MAP
    % THE BOTTOM OF MOST LAKES IN SPRINGWATER ISLAND ARE RUSTED METAL. THEY WERE LEFT THERE BY THE TALL KIN IN AN ANCIENT WAR AGAINST THE OTHER DOMINATING SPECIES WHO ACTUALLY DID DEVELOP METALLURGY.
    % LEAVE METALLURGY AS AN ANCIENT ART THAT SPARKED AMONG THE MODERN CIVILIZATIONS FROM ANCIENT AF WALL CARVINGS FOUND IN CAVERNS BELOW KRUDZAL.
    % NOTE: THERE ARE COLOSSAL ARMS PUSHING CABB-GOEM RLAMESH OUT OF THE OCEAN. THESE ARE THE HIGHER KIN, FORBIDDING THE TALL KIN PASSAGE INTO THEIR DOMAINS.

    % TODO: CHANGE ALL INSTANCES OF WHYTLANDE TO GRONSELAR
    % TODO: CHANGE ALL INSTANCES OF "THE FORBIDDEN LANDS" TO "THE DEAD SEA"
    % TODO: CHANGE TALL ONES TO ETS
    % TODO: CHANGE "NAENK TRIBES" TO "NAENK CIRCLES"
    % TODO: CHANGE COLDBLOOD BEASTS TO BLUEBLOOD BEASTS. All foreigner kins have blue blood btw.
    % TODO: CHANGE BOGGARTS AND FROSTBURN UMANS TO BE MORE GOBLINOID IN NATURE - THEY WERE ONCE LOST ONES, RECOVERED BY THE UMANS.
    % TODO: REMOVE A LINE OF VEGETATION SOUTH OF BYUREV - THEY CUT A TON OF TREES IN PREPARATION OF ISKEN'S INVASION.
    % TODO: Make a list of how to write each country and its people. As in: Kaldrathal - Kaldrathian
    % TODO: Update the colors I'm using for the tides to fit better with the colors in the document
    % TODO: MAKE SURE THAT I ALWAYS WROTE DRATL IRD. I THINK I USED THE TERM "ZSEK IRD" MORE THAN ONCE FUCK FUCK FUCK
    % TODO: Change all instances of "Thul'kraka" irds to "Thulkraka".
    % TODO: Make a custom character sheet?

    % NOTE: Hulnar's long lineage of kings supposedly came from the tall kin, and are named using jantherlin names.
    % NOTE: After the schism, many of the peoples from the immigrant kins couldn't find qualia, and each of the three species were divided into two, the "normal" ones and the lost ones:
    % umans - goblinoids
    % tortles - ???
    % grungs - slaadi
    % NOTE: Current year: 673 AS.
    % NOTE: Tortle and grung blood work for spellcasting just as umans blood, but it is much less effective. Blood sold by umans that travel with grungs and tortles tends to have lower values due to this.
    % NOTE: Fucking penguins as a subrace sounds pretty interesting.

    % * Mountain irds of Krugghom and polar region, harsh society. Great smiths and hunters. Friendly to gats.
    % * Gat traditionalist nation. Capital is the Gateless City. Used to be grand, but they took the schism hard due to being so close the the spire during the schism, and is now having a little trouble keeping up. Constrained to the area north of the forbidden lands.
