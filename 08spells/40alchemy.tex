    \DndSpellHeader{I: Poison Breath \label{spell::poisonbreath}}
        {Alchemy spell - 2 spell points}
        {2/3 actions}
        {Touch}
        {V, M (hot pepper dust)}
        {Instantaneous}
        You cause your zuan to spew a poisonous cloud in a B-meters cone.
        Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

        You can consume up to 8 additional spell points to increase the damage of this spell by 1d6 for each spell point beyond 2.
        In addition, you can use another action and consume an additional spell points to induce a creature within 24 meters to exhale the cloud as a reaction.
        The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or it exhales the cloud in a direction of your choice.
        A creature can choose to fail this saving throw.
    \DndSpellHeader{II: Cloudkill \label{spell::cloudkill}}
        {Alchemy spell - 7 spell points}
        {2 actions}
        {Touch}
        {S, M (rotten food)}
        {Concentration, up to 10 minutes}
        You cause your zuan to discharge a B-meter-radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog.
        The fog spreads around corners.
        It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell.
        Its area is heavily obscured.

        When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw.
        The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
        Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.

        The fog moves 2 meters away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground.
        The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.

        You can consume up to 4 additional spell points when you cast this spell, increasing the damage by 1d8 for each point consumed.
        Once per turn while concentrating on the spell, you can use an action on your turn to move the cloud up to 4 meters in a direction of your choice.
    \DndSpellHeader{I: Burning Cone \label{spell::burningcone}}
        {Alchemy spell - 2 spell points}
        {2 actions}
        {Touch}
        {V, S}
        {Instantaneous}
        A thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your zuan.
        Each creature in a B-meter cone must make a Dexterity saving throw.
        A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
        The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

        You can consume up to 8 additional spell points when you cast this spell, the damage increases by 1d6 for each point beyond the first 2.
        In addition, you can consume 4 spell points and an action to cause the zuan to spin while casting this spell, changing its range to a B-meter circle instead of a cone.
    \DndSpellHeader{II: Incendiary Cloud \label{spell::incendiarycloud}}
        {Alchemy spell - 11 spell points}
        {2 actions}
        {Touch}
        {V, S}
        {Concentration, up to 1 minute}
        A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers appears in a B-meter-radius sphere centered on your zuan.
        The cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured.
        It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed disperses it.

        When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw.
        A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
        A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

        The cloud moves along with your zuan.

        Each turn while the spell is active, you can use an action and consume 2 spell points to cause the ground under the smoke to heat up, turning it into difficult terrain for one minute.
        Any creature that starts its turn standing in this terrain or moves through it takes 1d6 fire damage.
    \DndSpellHeader{I: Dispel Magic \label{spell::dispelmagic}}
        {Alchemy spell - 5 spell points}
        {2 actions}
        {24 meters}
        {V, S}
        {Instantaneous}
        Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range.
        Any spell that costs 5 spell points or less on the target ends.
        For each spell that costs more than that, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability.
        The DC equals 6 + its spell point cost.
        On a successful check, the spell ends.

        You can consume up to 8 additional spell points when you cast this spell.
        When you do so, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell's cost is equal to or less than the cost you consumed.
    \DndSpellHeader{II: Antimagic Field \label{spell::antimagicfield}}
        {Alchemy spell - 11 spell points}
        {2 actions}
        {Touch}
        {V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or iron filings)}
        {Concentration, up to 1 hour}
        A B/2-meter-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds a zuan of your choice.
        Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and all enchantments are lost.
        Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with the zuan, centered on it.

        Spells and other magical effects are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it.
        Spell points expended to cast a suppressed spell are consumed.
        While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

        \paragraph{Targeted Effects}
        Spells and other magical effects that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.

        \paragraph{Areas of Magic}
        The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere.
        If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.
        For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.

        \paragraph{Spells}
        Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.

        \paragraph{Enchanted Items}
        The properties and powers of enchanted items are suppressed in the sphere.
        An enchanted weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere.
        If the weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

        \paragraph{Magical Travel}
        Teleportation fails to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel.
        A portal to another location or plane  temporarily closes while in the sphere.

        \paragraph{Creatures and Objects}
        A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere.
        Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.

        \paragraph{Dispel Magic}
        Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere.
        Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don't nullify each other.
    \DndSpellHeader{I: Stinking Cloud \label{spell::stinkingcloud}}
        {Alchemy spell - 5 spell points}
        {2 actions}
        {Touch}
        {V, S, M (a rotten egg)}
        {Concentration, up to 1 minute}
        You create a B-meter-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on your zuan.
        The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured.
        The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.

        Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison.
        On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling.
        Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.

        A moderate wind disperses the cloud after 4 rounds.
        A strong wind disperses it after 1 round.

        Once per turn while concentrating on the spell, you can use an action on your turn to move the cloud up to 4 meters in a direction of your choice.
    \DndSpellHeader{II: Contagion \label{spell::contagion}}
        {Alchemy spell - 7 spell points}
        {2 actions}
        {Touch}
        {V, S}
        {7 days}
        You move your zuan to touch a creature within a meter of it.
        Make a melee spell attack against the creature.
        On a hit, the target is poisoned.

        At the end of each of the poisoned target's turns, the target must make a Constitution saving throw.
        If the target succeeds on three of these saves, it is no longer poisoned, and the spell ends.
        If the target fails three of these saves, the target is no longer poisoned, but choose one of the diseases below.
        The target is subjected to the chosen disease for the spell's duration.

        Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease's effects apply to it.

        \paragraph{Blinding Sickness}
        Pain grips the creature's mind, and its eyes turn milky white.
        The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is blinded.
        \paragraph{Filth Fever}
        A raging fever sweeps through the creature's body.
        The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.
        \paragraph{Flesh Rot}
        The creature's flesh decays.
        The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.
        \paragraph{Mindfire}
        The creature's mind becomes feverish.
        The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature must roll on the Confusion Behaviour table every turn during combat.
        \paragraph{Seizure}
        The creature is overcome with shaking.
        The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.
        \paragraph{Slimy Doom}
        The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably.
        The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws.
        In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is stunned until the end of its next turn.

        \begin{DndTable}[width=\linewidth, header=Confusion Behaviour]{ll}
            \textbf{d10} & \textbf{Behaviour} \\
            1 &
            The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction.
            To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face.
            The creature doesn't take any other action this turn. \\
            2-6 &
            The creature doesn't take actions this turn. \\
            7-8 &
            The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach.
            If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn. \\
            9-10 &
            The creature can act and move normally.
        \end{DndTable}
    \DndSpellHeader{I: Mass Healing \label{spell::masshealing}}
        {Alchemy spell - 5 spell points}
        {1 action}
        {Touch}
        {V}
        {Instantaneous}
        All friendly creatures within B meters of your zuan regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting modifier.
        This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

        You can consume up to 6 additional spell points when casting this spell, increasing the healing by 1d4 for each point.
    \DndSpellHeader{II: Aura of Purity \label{spell::auraofpurity}}
        {Alchemy spell - 6 spell points}
        {2 actions}
        {Touch}
        {V}
        {Concentration, up to 10 minutes}
        Purifying energy radiates from your zuan in an aura with a B-meter radius.
        Until the spell ends, the aura moves with it, centered on the zuan.
        Each nonhostile creature in the aura (including you) can't become diseased, has resistance to poison damage, and has advantage on saving throws against effects that cause any of the following conditions: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, and stunned.

        Once per turn while concentrating on this spell, you can consume one action and 2 spell points to heal all creatures within the aura hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
    \DndSpellHeader{I: Calm Emotions \label{spell::calmemotions}}
        {Alchemy spell - 3 spell points}
        {2 actions}
        {Touch}
        {V, S}
        {Concentration, up to 1 minute}
        You create a B-meter radius sphere of calmness around your zuan.
        Each creature in the sphere's radius must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes.
        If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.

        You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened.
        When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.

        Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward.
        This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed.
        When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the DM rules otherwise.

        While concentrating on this spell, you can choose to use 2 actions and spend 4 additional spell points to extend the effect of this spell to one hour.
    \DndSpellHeader{II: Zone of Truth \label{spell::zoneoftruth}}
        {Alchemy spell - 3 spell points}
        {2 actions}
        {Touch}
        {V, S}
        {10 minutes}
        You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a B-meter-radius sphere centered on your zuan.
        Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw.
        On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius.
        You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.

        An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie.
        Such creatures can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.
    \DndSpellHeader{I: Elemental Protection \label{spell::elementalprotection}}
        {Alchemy spell - 5 spell points}
        {2 actions}
        {Touch}
        {V, S}
        {Concentration, up to 1 hour}
        For the duration, a willing creature within a meter of your zuan has resistance to one damage type of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.

        You can spend an additional action and 4 more spell points to cause this effect on all willing creatures within a meter of your zuan --- including you.
    \DndSpellHeader{II: Elemental Bane \label{spell::elementalbane}}
        {Alchemy spell - 6 spell points}
        {2 actions}
        {Touch}
        {V, S}
        {Concentration, up to 1 minute}
        Choose one creature within a meter of your zuan, and choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.
        The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be affected by the spell for its duration.
        The first time each turn the affected target takes damage of the chosen type, the target takes an extra 2d6 damage of that type.
        Moreover, the target loses any resistance to that damage type until the spell ends.

        You can spend an additional action and 4 more spell points to cause this effect on all creatures within a meter of your zuan.
    \DndSpellHeader{I: Investiture of Wind \label{spell::investitureofwind}}
        {Alchemy spell - 7 spell points}
        {2 actions}
        {Touch}
        {V, S}
        {Concentration, up to 10 minutes}
        Until the spell ends, wind whirls in a B-meter radius sphere centered on your zuan, causing the following effects:

        \begin{\begin{itemize}
            \item Ranged weapon attacks that pass through the sphere have disadvantage on the attack roll.
            \item Creatures inside the sphere gain a flying speed of 12 meters.
            These creatures also move together with your zuan when you move it.
            Any creature still flying when the spell ends falls, unless they can somehow prevent it.
            \item Once per turn while concentrating on the spell, you can use an actions to create a 3-meter cube of swirling wind centered on a point within 12 meters of your zuan.
            Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw.
            A creature takes 2d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
            If a Large or smaller creature fails the save, that creature is also pushed up to 2 meters away from the center of the cube.
        \end{itemize}}
    \DndSpellHeader{II: Whirlwind \label{spell::Whirlwind}}
        {Alchemy spell - 10 spell points}
        {2 actions}
        {Touch}
        {V, M (a piece of straw)}
        {Concentration, up to 1 minute}
        A whirlwind howls down from your zuan.
        The whirlwind is a B/2-meter-radius, B-meter-high cylinder centered on the zuan.
        The whirlwind moves along with your zuan.
        The whirlwind sucks up any Medium or smaller objects that aren't secured to anything and that aren't worn or carried by anyone.

        A creature must make a Dexterity saving throw the first time on a turn that it enters the whirlwind or that the whirlwind enters its space, including when the whirlwind first appears.
        A creature takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
        In addition, a Large or smaller creature that fails the save must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained in the whirlwind until the spell ends.
        When a creature starts its turn restrained by the whirlwind, the creature is pulled 1 meter higher inside it, unless the creature is at the top.
        A restrained creature moves with the whirlwind and falls when the spell ends, unless the creature has some means to stay aloft.

        A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check against your spell save DC.
        If successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the whirlwind and is hurled 3d12 meters away from it in a random direction.

        Upon touching any surface, it explodes into a 4-meter-radius sphere.
        Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw.
        On a failed save, a creature takes 10d4 acid damage and is covered in acid for I rounds.

        A healing gas flows from your zuan towards a creature within a meter of it.
        This ends one disease or one condition of your choice afflicting it.
