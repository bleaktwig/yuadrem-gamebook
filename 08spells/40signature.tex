\DndSpellHeader{Rhelath's Dance \label{spell::rhelathsdance}}
    {Warchanter signature spell - Variable spell points}
    {2 actions}
    {Touch}
    {V, M (a few hairs from a bull)}
    {Concentration, up to 10 minutes}
    You endow a creature affected by the Rage medium with endurance fueled by your alchemy.
    Until the spell ends, the creature gains the following benefits:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The creature gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your level times 5.
        If any of these remain when the spell ends, they are lost.
        \item The creature's multiple attack penalty is reduced to 0.
        \item When the creature hits a target with a melee weapon attack using Strength, that target takes an extra 1d8 force damage.
        This damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
        \item The creature has advantage on Constitution saving throws.
        \item The creature's fingernails sharpen, ready to deliver a corrosive attack.
        On an unarmed strike, the creature can choose to deal 1d8 acid damage + their Strength modifier instead of the normal damage for such an attack.
    \end{itemize}

    When this effect ends, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion.

    The cost for casting this spell is equal to your level divided by 2 (rounded down).

    Every turn the creature is affected by this spell, your zuan loses 1 fagal alignment point.
    If it drops to zero, the spell ends early.

\DndSpellHeader{Screaming Bead \label{spell::screamingbead}}
    {Flamespeaker signature spell - 2 spell points}
    {2 actions}
    {30 meters}
    {S, M (a firetrap)}
    {Up to 24 hours}
    You cause an ember within range to turn into a glowing yellow bead.
    When you end the spell, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners.
    Each creature in a 4-meter-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw.
    A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

    The spell's base damage is 2d6.
    If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the bead grows slightly and the damage increases by 2d6.
    The maximum number of damage dice of this spell is equal to your level.
    When the spell reaches this damage, the bead stops growing.

    The bead sheds a bright light up to a radius equal to 1/4ths its number of damage dice in meters and dim light up to double that distance.

    The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.

    This spell consumes two spell points when you cast it, and one additional spell point for each two damage dice added to it (one additional point at 4d6, another at 6d6, etc).
