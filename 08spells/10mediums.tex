\DndSpellHeader{Electric Link: Charge \label{medium::charge}}
    {Sympathy medium}
    {1 action}
    {12 mt.}
    {S}
    {Up to an hour}
    You add a charge to a creature or object within range.
    A creature or object can have a total number of charges lesser or equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your spellcasting proficiency bonus, but an arbitrary number of creatures can have charges at the same time.
    A creature can lose its charges only by being affected by certain sympathy spells, as specified in the spells' descriptions.

    Using two actions, you can affect a charged creature or object in one of the following ways:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Attract}.
        You cause the creature or object to be attracted to the closest metal object it is not wearing or carrying.
        The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be moved a number of meters equal to the number of charges it has towards the object.
        Creatures of size Large or larger make this roll with advantage.
        Objects automatically roll a number equal to their weight (in kg) divided by 5.
        \item \textbf{Discharge}.
        You cause the creature to violently discharge, causing it to lose all charges.
        The creature must roll a Constitution saving throw.
        A creature takes 1d6 thunder damage plus 1d6 lightning damage for each charge it loses in this way on a failed save, taking half damage on a successful one.
        This spell's base damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
        \item \textbf{Repel}.
        You cause two charged creatures or objects to be repelled from each other.
        Creatures must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be moved a number of meters equal to half the sum of the number of charges the two creatures have (rounded down).
        Creatures of size Large or larger make this roll with advantage.
        Objects automatically roll a number equal to their weight (in kg) divided by 5.
    \end{itemize}
\DndSpellHeader{Fagal Affinity: Rage \label{medium::rage}}
    {Warchanter medium}
    {2 actions}
    {Touch}
    {V}
    {Up to 10 minutes}
    A small crimson tetrahedron emerges from your zuan, penetrating the skin of a willing creature of your choice within range.
    The creature takes 1d4 piercing damage as it is infused with primal ferocity, entering a rage.

    While raging, a creature gains the following benefits:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
        \item When it makes a melee weapon attack using Strength, it gains a bonus to the damage roll equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.
        \item It has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
        \item If it is able to cast spells, it can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.
    \end{itemize}

    For each round that the creature is raging you burn 1 spell point.
    The rage ends if the creature falls unconscious or dies.
    You can also use an action on your turn to end the rage.

    While the creature is raging, you can use an action and consume two additional spell points to produce one of the following effects:
    \subparagraph{Primal Frenzy}
    During the creature's next turn, it can make a single melee weapon attack as a free action during its turn.
    This attack doesn't cause and isn't affected by the multiple attack penalty.
    \subparagraph{Feral Instinct}
    Until the beginning of your next turn, the creature cannot be charmed or frightened.
    If it is charmed or frightened when you use this ability, the effect ends.
    \subparagraph{Instinctive Pounce}
    When you use this ability, the creature can move up to its moving speed towards a creature within reach and make a melee attack using Strength as a reaction.

    Only one creature can be affected by this medium at the same time.

    The ember can lie on a point ocuppied by another creature, stays in position for the spell's duration, and is visible.
    Other creatures can snuff out the flame by covering it in water or by enclosing it on a closed volume of medium or lesser size.
