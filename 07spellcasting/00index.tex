% NOTE. Lost spellcasting doctrines:
% ELDREMRY - indigo tide, earth, cross
%     Born from the indigo tide, Eldremry focuses on reshaping earth itself.
%     Hairuus invented the school of Shazdrala, but its lost to time.
%     Spells from this doctrine were used by Hairuus to create their cities, but it was lost along with the nation.
% ULDAMMY - white tide, wind, void.
%     Focuses on changing the wind (like Dentrala - Windherding), lack of stuff (like Darkness) and shit.
% RASHID
%     Manipulates the connection between tides and bringing in the essence of them.
%     The spellcasting focus for Rhashid and any tidal magic is your qualar.
