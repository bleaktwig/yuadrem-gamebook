        Armor of Strength &
        \textit{Prerequisite: A suit of armor (requires attunement)}.

        This armor has 6 charges. The wearer can expend the armor's charges in the following ways:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item When the wearer makes a Strength check or a Strength saving throw, it can expend 1 charge to add a bonus to the roll equal to its Intelligence modifier.
            \item If the creature would be knocked prone, it can use its reaction to expend 1 charge to avoid being knocked prone.
        \end{itemize}
        The armor regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. \\

        Enhanced Focus    &
        \textit{Prerequisite: An arcane focus (requires attunement)}.

        While holding this item, a creature gains a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls. In addition, the creature ignores half cover when making a spell attack.

        The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level. \\

        Enhanced Defense  &
        \textit{Prerequisite: A suit of armor or a shield}.

        The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level. \\

        Enhanced Weapon   &
        \textit{Prerequisite: A simple or martial weapon}.

        Mind Sharpener    &

        If you load no ammunition in the weapon, it produces its own, automatically creating one piece of ammunition when you make a ranged attack with it.
