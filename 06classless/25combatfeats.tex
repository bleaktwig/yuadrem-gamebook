\subsection*{Combat Feats}
For simplicity in searching, combat feats are separated into broad categories.
These categories pertain to what the feats involve, and are: Armor, Shield, Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons, Special Weapons, Damage Types, and Fighting Styles.

Special weapons are simple or martial weapons that require special training to be used effectively, and thus they have feats of their own to reflect this.

% TODO. Add proficiency with spears.

\subsubsection{Action Surge (2 FP)} \label{feat::actionsurge}
    Thanks to rigorous martial training, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a limited time.
    On your turn, you can take 3 additional actions.
    In addition, you can ignore the multiple attack penalty during this turn.
    \paragraph{Requirements} Fighting Style: Battle Mastery 1.

    \paragraph{Requirements} Skilled proficiency with Simple Weapons.
\subsubsection{Agile Grappler} \label{feat::agilegrappler}
    You can take this feat three times, gaining different benefits each time:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item When you take the Grapple action, you can use a monastic die to roll on the contest using your Dexterity (Acrobatics) instead of your Strength (Athletics), adding the result of the die to the check.
        \item When you attempt to grapple a creature, you choose what the creature rolls in the contest between Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics).
        \item When you successfully grapple a creature, you can use another monastic die to make one melee attack against the creature as a free action, adding the result of the die to the damage roll.
    \end{itemize}
    \paragraph{Requirements} Fighting Style: Monastic Fighting 1.
\subsubsection{Agile in a Suit} \label{feat::agileinasuit}

    \paragraph{Requirements} Proficiency with Medium Armor.
\subsubsection{Aimed Cut} \label{feat::aimedcut}
    You can take this feat three times, learning a different specialized cut each time:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The first time you take this feat, you learn how to perform a leg cut.
        When you hit a creature with an attack that deals slashing damage, you halve the creature's movement speed until the start of your next turn.
        \item The second time, you learn how to perform an arm cut.
        Pick one of the creature's arms.
        You aim for that arm when you make an attack that deals slashing damage, and all attacks made with that hand are made with disadvantage until the start of your next turn.
        \item The third time, you learn how to cause a hemorrhage.
        For the next minute after being hit by your attack with a slashing weapon, the creature takes 1d4 slashing damage at the start of each of its turns.
        It can staunch this wound using two actions, ending the effect early.
        This effect is not cummulative.
    \end{itemize}

    You can only perform any of these cuts once per turn.
\subsubsection{Appropiate Response (2 FP)} \label{feat::appropiateresponse}
    You learn the Riposte reaction (see page \pageref{act::riposte}).

    In addition, when you use this reaction while wielding a rapier, you attack twice instead of once.

    \paragraph{Requirements} Fighting Style: Battle Mastery 1.
\subsubsection{Aura of Protection} \label{feat::auraofprotection}
    Allies around you are emboldened by your presence.
    Whenever a friendly creature (excluding you) within 2 meters of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1).
    You must be conscious to grant this bonus.
    \paragraph{Requirements} Fighting Style: Protection 2.
\subsubsection{Axemaster} \label{feat::axemaster}
    More than a simple tool, you master the use of axes in combat.

    You increase your proficiency level with axes.

    \paragraph{Requirements} Proficiency with Medium Armor.
\subsubsection{Bend Metal (2 FP)} \label{feat::bendmetal}
    When you hit a creature with a hammer, you can choose to not damage it; instead focusing in its armor.
    If the creature is wearing armor with the Chain, Plate, or Natural property, it applies a -1 penalty to its AC.

    Damaged armor can be repaired by someone Skilled with Smith's tools, and it usually costs a quarter or half of the cost of the armor, to the DM's discretion.
    If you reduce the AC bonus given by the armor to 0, the armor is destroyed irreparably.

    Natural armor damaged by this feat heals over time, regaining its original AC over the course of a long rest.
    \paragraph{Requirements} Expert proficiency with Hammers.
\subsubsection{Bent Blade Master} \label{feat::bentblademaster}

    \paragraph{Requirements} Proficiency with Medium Shields.
\subsubsection{Blind Fighter} \label{feat::blindfighter}
    You have blindsight with a range of 2 meters.
    Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness.
    Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.
    \paragraph{Requirements} Fighting Style: Monastic Fighting 2.
\subsubsection{Blowgun Master} \label{feat::blowgunmaster}
    You increase your proficiency level with blowguns.
    This feat can be taken three times, or until you reach Expert proficiency with the weapon type.
\subsubsection{Blunt Fighter} \label{feat::bluntfighter}
