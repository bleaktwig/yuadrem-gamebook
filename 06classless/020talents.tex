        Knowing the local trade like the back of your hand, you know where to find the best ingredients for the cheapest prices in a settlement in which you are familiar.
        You can buy components and ingredients related to your craft for half their normal price, and you can tell the quality of a raw material just by looking at it.
        To use this feat you must first gain familiarity with a settlement as part of a long rest.

    \subsubsection{Artificer's Infusion} \label{feat::artificersinfusion}
        You gain the ability to imbue mundane items with infusions.

        When you gain this feature, pick four infusions to learn, choosing from the ``Artificer Infusions'' table.
        The description of each of the following infusions details the type of item that can receive it, along with whether the resulting magic item requires attunement.
        Unless an infusion's description says otherwise, you can't learn an infusion more than once.

        Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions.
        An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion's description.
        If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item.
        If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see ``Attunement'' in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).

        Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but only one object can be infused at a time.
        If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.

        You can learn this feat 3 times.
        The second and third time, you learn an additional infusion, and increase the number of objects that can be infused at the same time by one.

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item When the wearer makes a Strength check or a Strength saving throw, it can expend 1 charge to add a bonus to the roll equal to its Intelligence modifier.

                The item has 4 charges.
                When the wearer fails a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, the wearer can use its reaction to expend 1 of the item's charges to succeed instead.

                If you load no ammunition in the weapon, it produces its own, automatically creating one piece of ammunition when you make a ranged attack with it.
                The ammunition created by the weapon vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target. \\

                Returning Weapon  &
                \textit{Prerequisite: A simple or martial weapon with the thrown property}.

            3  & A scoundrel with a masked guise.                   \\

        Most of the people who know you do so as your persona.
        Those who seek to learn more about you --- your weaknesses, your origins, your purpose --- find themselves stymied by your disguise.
        Upon donning a disguise and behaving as your persona, you are unidentifiable as your true self.
        By removing your disguise and revealing your true face, you are no longer identifiable as your persona.
        This allows you to change appearances between your two personalities as often as you wish, using one to hide the other or serve as convenient camouflage.

        That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.

        Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes.
        The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.
        Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost.

    \subsubsection{Retainers} \label{feat::retainers}
        You gain the service of three retainers loyal to your family.
        These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo.
        One of your retainers can serve as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on their own path to knighthood.
        Another retainer might be a groom to care for your horse or a servant who polishes your armor and helps you put it on.

        Your retainers can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons).
        Your retainers will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused, and it will take your family 1d6 weeks to send you a new group.
        \paragraph{REQUIREMENTS} Noble background.

        You learn one Fighting Style (see page \pageref{ssec::fightingstyles}) or one Casting Style (see page \pageref{ssec::castingstyle}) of your choice.
        If you already have a style, the one you choose must be different.

    % ========================================================================== %

    \subsubsection{Promise of Status} \label{feat::promiseofstatus}
        As an action, you shout your family name to inspire fear from your enemies.
        Each creature that can hear and understand you within 9 meters of you must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw.
        On a failure, the creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
        At the DM's discretion, a creature might alternatively cease fighting altogether or even join your cause, expecting retribution from your family afterwards.

        You can use this ability a number of times per short rest equal to your Charisma modifier (Minimum of one).

        You can learn this feat a total of three times, increasing the DC to 15 the second time and to 18 the third.

    \subsubsection{Kept in Style (2 FP)} \label{feat::keptinstyle}
        Your family is known across the realm, and your attitude reflects this.
        Your name and signet are sufficient to cover most of your expenses, since everyone would prefer to be in your family's good graces.

        This advantage enables you and your companions to receive most services for free, as long as the cost doesn't rise above 10 agnomas.
        For services up to 50 agnomas, roll a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight).
        On a success, you can enjoy the service for free.

        At the DM discretion, this feat may be used for more expensive or rarer services, perhaps with disadvantage on the roll or by promising a reward to the service provider.

        Years of arguing and interacting at seas have made your insults extraordinarily effective.

        The creature must roll a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw.
        On a failure, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you and can't make opportunity attacks against targets other than you.
        This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the target or affects it with a spell, or until you and the target are more than 18 meters apart.

        You can use this ability a number of times per short rest equal to your Charisma modifier (Minimum of one).
