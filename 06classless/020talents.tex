    Most of the world know you as your persona.
    Those who seek to learn more about you --- your weaknesses, your origins, your purpose --- find themselves stymied by your disguise.
    Upon donning a disguise and behaving as your persona, you are unidentifiable as your true self.
    By removing your disguise and revealing your true face, you are no longer identifiable as your persona.
    This allows you to change appearances between your two personalities as often as you wish, using one to hide the other or serve as convenient camouflage.
    However, should someone realize the connection between your persona and your true self, your deception might lose its effectiveness.

    Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed.
    In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.

    Guilds often wield tremendous political power.
    If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable.
    You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing.
    Such connections might require the donation to the guild's coffers.

    You must pay dues of 5 agnomas per month to the guild.
    If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild's good graces.

    It could be a site that no one else has ever seen.
    You might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history.
    It might be information that would be damaging to the people who or consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.
