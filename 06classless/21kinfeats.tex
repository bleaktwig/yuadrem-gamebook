\subsubsection{Acid Spit} \label{feat::acidspit}
    By repeatedly feeding on toxic tree leaves, your saliva has become as vile as its poison.
    You can use two actions to spit a 1 by 6 meters line of acid.
    Every target in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, with a DC of 8 + your Constitution modifier.
    A creature takes 2d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
    The acid damage increases to 3d6 with your 6th level, 4d6 with your 11th, and 5d6 with your 16th.
    You can use this trait a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (Minimum of 1) per short rest.
