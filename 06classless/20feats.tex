\section{Feats}
For simplicity, feats are separated into six categories: feats related to kin, background, skills, proficiencies, combat, and spellcasting.
Each category is listed in the following pages.
Categories are ordered alfabetically, but each is listed in an easy to follow fashion in their respective sections.

Unless specified otherwise, a feat can only be learned once.
