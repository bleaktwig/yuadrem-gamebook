\subsection*{Proficiency Feats}
% NOTE: DIVIDED INTO THRRE, TOOL PROFICIENCIES, LAND VEHICLES, AND KITS.

\subsection*{Tool Proficiencies}
    You can use a set of Artisan's Tools to craft items as part of a long rest.
    Make an ordered list of the items you want to make.
    The items you have access to depend on your proficiency level with the tools, and are detailed in each tools' associated proficiency feat.
    Each item in the list has an associated DC and cost, which is equal to its DC and cost plus these values for all the previous items on the list.

    The DC of an item depends on its rarity and its associated proficiency.
    They are listed in the tools' proficiency feat.
    % Common items have a DC of 6, Uncommon items have a DC of 9, Rare items a DC of 12, Very Rare a DC of 15, and legendary a DC of 20.

    After you finish the list, make an ability check with the relevant toolset.
    The number you roll determines how far down the list you are able to craft, and the cost you need to pay for components.
