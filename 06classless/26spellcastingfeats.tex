% NOTE: FROM SPELLCASTING STYLES
% \subsubsection{Spell Sniper}
% You have learned techniques to enhance your attacks with ranged spells, gaining the following benefits:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item When you cast a spell that requires you to make an attack roll, the spell's range is doubled.
%     \item Your ranged spell attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.
%     \item You learn one cantrip that requires an attack roll. Choose the cantrip from the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list. Your spellcasting ability for this cantrip depends on the spell list you chose from: Charisma for bard, sorcerer, or warlock; Wisdom for cleric or druid; or Intelligence for wizard.
