    \DndSpellHeader{Control Flames \label{spell::controlflames}}
        {Sympathy cantrip}
        {2 actions}
        {12 mt.}
        {S}
        {Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)}
        You choose flame that you can see within range and that fits within a 1-meter cube.
        You affect it in one of the following ways:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item You instantaneously expand the flame 1 meter in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present in the new location.
            \item You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube.
            \item You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both.
            The change lasts for 1 hour.
            \item You cause simple shapes---such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location---to appear within the flames and animate as you like.
            The shapes last for 1 hour.
        \end{itemize}
        If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three non-instantaneous effects created by it active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
    \DndSpellHeader{Produce Flame \label{spell::produceflame}}
        {Flamespeaker cantrip}
        {1/2 actions}
        {Self}
        {V, S}
        {10 minutes}
        A flickering flame appears in your hand, the tip of a blowpipe you're holding, or the inside of a firetrap you carry (your choice).
        The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment.
        The flame sheds bright light in a 2-meter radius and dim light for an additional 2 meters.
        The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.

        You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell.
        As an action, you can hurl the flame within 6/18 meters of you.
        If you hurl it towards a creature, make a ranged spell attack against its AC.
        On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

        If you casted the spell using two actions, the flame remains in the place where it landed for up to one minute (requires concentration).
        Any creature that moves to the flame's space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 fire damage.

        The flame ignites flammable objects in its area that aren't being worn or carried.

        This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
\subsection*{Signature Spells}
    \DndSpellHeader{Whispering Ember \label{spell::whisperingember}}
        {Flamespeaker signature spell}
        {2 actions}
        {Self}
        {V, M (a firetrap)}
        {Up until the caster detonates it}
        At the end of your turn, a glowing yellow bead appears inside a firetrap you're carrying.
        When the spell ends, either because its duration is up or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners.
        Each creature in a 4-meter-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw.
        A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

        The spell's base damage is 1d6.
        If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the bead grows slightly and the damage increases by 1d6.
        The maximum number of damage dice of this spell is equal to your level.
        When the spell reaches this damage, the bead stops growing.

        The bead sheds a bright light up to a radius equal to 1/4ths of its number of damage dice in meters and dim light up to double that distance.

        As an action, you can throw the bead to a distance equal to 6/18 mt.
        The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.

        This spell consumes one spell point when you cast it, and one additional spell point for each two damage dice added to it (one point at 3d6, another at 5d6, etc).
\subsection*{Cantrips}
    \DndSpellHeader{Dancing Lights \label{spell::dancinglights}}
        {Sympathy cantrip}
        {2 actions}
        {24 mt.}
        {V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus)}
        {Concentration, up to 1 minute}
        You create up to four torch-sized lights within range that hover in the air for the duration.
        You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vague form of Medium size.
        Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 2-meter radius.

        As an action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 12 meters to a new spot within range. A light must be within 4 meters of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.

        As an action during your turn, you can momentarily heat up the lights.
        Any creature standing in the same spot as a light rolls a Dexterity saving throw.
        On a failure, it takes 1d4 fire damage.
        You can heat up the lights only once per turn.
    \DndSpellHeader{Fire Bolt \label{spell::firebolt}}
        {Sympathy cantrip}
        {2/3 actions}
        {24 mt.}
        {V, S}
        {Instantaneous}
        You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range.
        Make a ranged spell attack against the target.
        On a hit, the target takes 1d10 fire damage.
        A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn't being worn or carried.

        If you cast this spell using 3 actions, you can hurl two motes instead of one, targetting two different creatures.

        This spell's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).
    \DndSpellHeader{Flaming Blade \label{spell::flamingblade}}
        {Sympathy cantrip}
        {1 action}
        {Self (1-meter radius)}
        {S, M (a melee weapon)}
        {Instantaneous}
        You empower the weapon used in the spell's casting with fire until the end of your turn.
        When you make a melee attack with the weapon, you can cause a fire to leap from the target to a different creature of your choice that is within 1 meter of it.
        The second creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

        This spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels.
        At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target on a hit, and the fire damage to the second creature increases to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
        Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8 and 2d8) and 17th level (3d8 and 3d8).
    \DndSpellHeader{Mind Sliver \label{spell::mindsliver}}
        {Sympathy cantrip}
        {2/3 actions}
        {12 meters}
        {V}
        {1 round}
        You drive a heat directly into the mind of one creature you can see within range.
        The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage and subtract 1d4 from the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.

        If you casted this spell using 3 actions, the creature substracts 2d4 from the saving throw.

        This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels: 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
\subsection*{1st-level Spells}
    \DndSpellHeader{Burning Hands \label{spell::burninghands}}
        {1st-level sympathy}
        {2/3 actions}
        {Self (3-meter cone)}
        {V, S}
        {Instantaneous}
        As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips.
        Each creature in a 3-meter cone must make a Dexterity saving throw.
        A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

        The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

        If you used 3 actions to cast the spell, the ground under the cone lights up in fire.
        Until the end of your next turn, any creature that moves to the area on a turn or ends its turn there must succeed a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 fire damage.

        \paragraph{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, both damages increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
    \DndSpellHeader{Chaos Bolt \label{spell::chaosbolt}}
        {1st-level sympathy}
        {2/3 actions}
        {24 meters}
        {V, S}
        {Instantaneous}
        You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range.
        Make a ranged spell attack against the target.
        On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage.
        Choose one of the d8s.
        The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown below.

        \begin{DndTable}[width=\linewidth, header=Chaos Bolt]{ll}
            \textbf{d8} & \textbf{Damage Type} \\
                     1  & Acid      \\
                     2  & Cold      \\
                     3  & Fire      \\
                     4  & Force     \\
                     5  & Lightning \\
                     6  & Poison    \\
                     7  & Psychic   \\
                     8  & Thunder
        \end{DndTable}
        If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 6 meters of it.
        Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.

        A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.

        If you cast the spell with three actions, you can make the blast explode on the targets face before hiting it.
        In addition to taking damage, the target rolls a Constitution saving throw.
        On a failed save, the target is blinded until the end of your next turn.
        This effects carries over to potential subsequent bolts.

        \paragraph{At Higher Levels}
        When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes 1d6 extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.
    \DndSpellHeader{Color Spray \label{spell::colorspray}}
        {1st-level Sympathy}
        {1/2/3 actions}
        {Self (3-meter cone)}
        {V, S, M (a pinch of powder or sand that is colored red, yellow, and blue)}
        {1 round}
        A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand.
        Roll 4d10; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can effect.
        Creatures in a 3-meter cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures and creatures that can't see).

        Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is blinded until the end of your next turn.
        Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points.
        A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

        If you cast this spell with 2 or 3 actions, you increase the dice rolled to 6d10 and 8d10 respectively.

        \paragraph{At Higher Levels}
        When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d10 for each slot level above 1st.
    \DndSpellHeader{Faerie Fire \label{spell::faeriefire}}
        {1st-level sympathy}
        {2 actions}
        {12 meters}
        {V}
        {Concentration, up to 1 minute}
        Each object in a 4-meter cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice).
        Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw.
        For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 2-meter radius.

        Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.
    \DndSpellHeader{Fog Cloud \label{spell::fogcloud}}
        {1st-level sympathy}
        {1/2/3 actions}
        {24 meters}
        {V, S}
        {Concentration, up to 1 hour}
        You create a 2-meter-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range.
        The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured.
        It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed disperses it.

        If you cast this spell using more than 1 action, you can create a number of spheres within range equal to the number of actions used.

        \paragraph{At Higher Levels}
        When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 2 meters for each slot level above 1st.
    \DndSpellHeader{Guiding Bolt \label{spell::guidingbolt}}
        {1st-level sympathy}
        {2/3 actions}
        {24 meters}
        {V, S}
        {1 round}
        A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range.
        Make a ranged spell attack against the target.
        On a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the dim light glittering on the target until then.

        If you cast this spell using 3 actions, the advantage granted lasts for two attacks instead of one.

        \paragraph{At Higher Levels}
        When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
    \DndSpellHeader{Hellish Rebuke \label{spell::hellishrebuke}}
        {1st level sympathy}
        {1 reaction, which you take in respose the being damage by a creature within 12 meters that you can see}
        {12 meters}
        {V, S}
        {Instantaneous}
        You point your finger, and the creature that damaged you is momentarily surrounded by hellish flames.
        The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw.
        It takes 2d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

        \paragraph{At Higher Levels}
        When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.
    \DndSpellHeader{Radiant Weapon \label{spell::radiantweapon}}
        {1st-level sympathy}
        {1 action}
        {Self}
        {V, S}
        {Concentration, up to 1 minute}
        Your magic empowers you with intense radiance.
        Until the spell ends, your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d4 radiant damage on a hit.
    \DndSpellHeader{Searing Smite \label{spell::searingsmite}}
        {1st-level sympathy}
        {1/2 actions}
        {Self}
        {V}
        {Concentration, up to 1 minute}
        The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during the spell's duration, your weapon flares with white-hot intensity, and the attack deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to the target and causes the target to ignite in flames.
        At the start of each of its turns until the spell ends, the target must make a Constitution saving throw.
        On a failed save, it takes 1d6 fire damage.
        On a successful save, the spell ends.
        If the target or a creature within 1 meter of it uses an action to put out the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames (such as the target being submerged in water), the spell ends.

        If you cast this spell using two actions, you extend its range to 6 meters, allowing you to use it on another creature's melee weapon.

        \paragraph{At Higher Levels}
        When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial extra damage dealt by the attack increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
    \DndSpellHeader{Warmth \label{spell::warmth}}
        {1st-level sympathy}
        {2 actions}
        {Touch}
        {V, S}
        {Instantaneous}
        A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
        This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

        \paragraph{At Higher Levels}
        When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
