    \DndSpellHeader{Heat Link: Ember \label{spell::ember}}
        {Sympathy medium}
        {2 actions}
        {12 mt.}
        {S}
        {Up to an hour}
        You produce a lingering ember that tethers to a point of your choice within range.
        The ember can lie on a point ocuppied by another creature, stays in position for the spell's duration, and is visible.
        Other creatures can snuff out the flame by covering it in water or by enclosing it on a closed volume of medium or lesser size.
        You can have a number of embers active at the same time equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

        Using an action, you can affect an ember in one of the following ways:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Move}.
            You move the ember up to 6 meters to a point within range.
            \item \textbf{Snuff Out}.
            You harmlessly snuff out the ember.
            \item \textbf{Explode}.
            The ember explodes, harming any creature(s) in the same space that the ember is.
            The creature(s) must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 fire damage.
            This damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
        \end{itemize}

        {2 actions}
        {Self}
        {S}
        {Until dispelled}
        You produce a lingering ember inside a firetrap you are carrying.
        This flame can be used to cast any sympathy spell as if it were a normal ember, but it doesn't count towards your total number of embers.
        You can move the ember outside the firetrap as if it were a normal ember, but it explodes at the end of your turn without requiring an action from you.
    \DndSpellHeader{Electric Link: Charge \label{spell::charge}}
        {Sympathy medium}
        {1 action}
        {12 mt.}
        {S}
        {Up to an hour}
        You add a charge to a creature or object within range.
        A creature or object can have a total number of charges lesser or equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, but an arbitrary number of creatures can have charges at the same time.
        A creature can lose its charges only by being discharged by a sympathy spellcaster or by being affected by certain sympathy spells, as specified in the spells' descriptions.

        Using two actions, you can affect a charged creature or object in one of the following ways:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Attract}.
            You cause the creature or object to be attracted to the closest metal object it is not wearing or carrying.
            The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be moved a number of meters equal to the number of charges it has towards the object.
            Creatures of size Large or larger make this roll with advantage.
            Objects automatically roll a number equal to their weight (in kg) divided by 5.
            \item \textbf{Discharge}.
            You cause the creature to violently discharge, causing it to lose all charges.
            The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 lightning damage plus 1d6 lightning damage for each charge it loses in this way.
            This spell's base damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
            \item \textbf{Repel}.
            You cause two charged creatures or objects to be repelled from each other.
            Creatures must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be moved a number of meters equal to half the sum of the number of charges the two creatures have (rounded down).
            Creatures of size Large or larger make this roll with advantage.
            Objects automatically roll a number equal to their weight (in kg) divided by 5.

        This ice lasts for 1 minute.
