\DndSpellHeader{Control Flames \label{spell::controlflames}}
    {cantrip}
    {2 actions}
    {12 mt.}
    {S}
    {Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)}
    You choose flame that you can see within range and that fits within a 1-meter cube.
    You affect it in one of the following ways:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item You instantaneously expand the flame 1 meter in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present in the new location.
        \item You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube.
        \item You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both.
        The change lasts for 1 hour.
        \item You cause simple shapes---such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location---to appear within the flames and animate as you like.
        The shapes last for 1 hour.
    \end{itemize}
    If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three non-instantaneous effects created by it active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
\DndSpellHeader{Produce Flame \label{spell::produceflame}}
    {Flamespeaker cantrip}
    {2 actions}
    {Self}
    {V, S}
    {10 minutes}
    A flickering flame appears in your hand, the tip of a blowpipe you're holding, or the inside of a firetrap you carry (your choice).
    The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment.
    The flame sheds bright light in a 2-meter radius and dim light for an additional 2 meters.
    The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.

    You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell.
    When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 6 meters of you.
    Make a ranged spell attack.
    On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

    This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
\DndSpellHeader{Whispering Ember \label{spell::whisperingember}}
    {Flamespeaker $\ast$ spell}
    {2 actions}
    {Self}
    {V, M (a firetrap)}
    {Up until the caster detonates it}
    At the end of your turn, a glowing yellow bead appears inside a firetrap you're carrying.
    When the spell ends, either because its duration is up or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners.
    Each creature in a 4-meter-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw.
    A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

    The spell's base damage is 1d6.
    If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the bead grows slightly and the damage increases by 1d6.
    The maximum number of damage dice of this spell is equal to your level.
    When the spell reaches this damage, the bead stops growing.

    The bead sheds a bright light up to a radius equal to 1/4ths of its number of damage dice in meters and dim light up to double that distance.

    As an action, you can throw the bead to a distance equal to 6/18 mt.
    The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.
