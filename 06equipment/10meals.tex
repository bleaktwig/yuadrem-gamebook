\section{Meals} \label{sec::meals}
    Unless otherwise specified, the prices listed for brews are for a feast, which feeds up to 8 creatures.
    Divide this by 8 for the price of one meal.

    A meal is consumed during the day, and its benefits (if any) last for the whole day.
    After cooked, the benefits associated to a meal last for one day, after which the food spoils.
    You can only be affected by one meal at the same time.
