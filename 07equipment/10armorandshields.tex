    \paragraph{Chain Shirt}

    \paragraph{Woven Steel Shirt}
        By using thin steel threads, a woven steel shirt provides good protection while remaining light.

\subsubsection{Heavy Armor} \label{ssec::heavyarmor}
    Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection.
    These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks.
    Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.
    Heavy armor doesn't let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn't penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

    The armor reduces the wearer's speed by 2 meters unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than 15.
