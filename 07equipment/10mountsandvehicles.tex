    \paragraph{Exotic Saddle}
        An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or flying mount.
    \paragraph{Galley}
        A galley has a speed of 6 km/h, and a carrying capacity of 150 tons.
        It requires a crew of 80 to run effectively, and it has an AC of 15, HP of 500, and a damage threshold of 20.
    \paragraph{Keelboat}
        A keelboat has a speed of 1.5 km/h, and a carrying capacity of half a ton plus 6 passengers at most.
        It requires a crew of 1, and it has an AC of 15, HP of 100, and a damage threshold of 10.

        Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers.
        If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 5 kilometers per hour) to the speed of the vehicle.
        These vehicles can't be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores.
    \paragraph{Longship}
        A longship has a speed of 5 km/h, and a carrying capacity of 10 tons plus a cargo of 150 passengers.
        It requires a crew of 40, and it has an AC of 15, HP of 300, and a damage threshold of 15.
    \paragraph{Military Saddle}
        A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle.
        It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted.
