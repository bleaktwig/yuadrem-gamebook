$\ast$ \textit{This weapon's properties, cost, and required toolset depend on the mundane version of the weapon in question.}

$\dagger$ \textit{This weapon is a variant.
Its base weapon can be any weapon in its category.}

\subsection*{Weapon Properties} \label{ssec::weaponproperties} % TODO. Finish.
    \subparagraph{Ammunition (A)}
        You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon.
        Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition.
        Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack.
        Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand.
        At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

        If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon.
        A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.
    \subparagraph{Finesse (F)}
        When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls.
        You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
    \subparagraph{Heavy (H)}
        Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons.
        A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

        In addition, the multiple attack penalty is increased to 6 for weapons with this property.
    \subparagraph{Light (L)}
        A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

        In addition, the multiple attack penalty is reduced to 4 for weapons with this property.
    \subparagraph{Loading (Load)}
        After attacking with this weapon, you need to use one action to reload it before attacking again.
        You must have one free hand to reload the weapon.
    \subparagraph{Misfiring (M)}
        Whenever you make an attack roll, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s misfire score, the weapon misfires.
        The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend two actions to try and repair it.
        To repair your weapon, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + the weapon's misfire score).
        If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended as part of a long rest at a quarter of its cost.
        Creatures who use a weapon without being proficient increase its misfire score by 1.
    \subparagraph{Reach (R)}
        This weapon adds 1 meters to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.
    \subparagraph{Special (S)}
        A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see ``Special Weapons'' later in this section).
    \subparagraph{Thrown (T)}
        If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack.
        If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon.
        For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the Dagger has the finesse property.
    % \subparagraph{Trick}
        % This weapon requires the Flexible Fighter 1 feat to use.
        % These weapons can be transformed into alternate forms and have different capabilities in this transformed state.
        % The weapons have two values for damage and properties, one for their normal form, and one for the transformed one.
    \subparagraph{Two-Handed (2H)}
        This weapon requires two hands to attack with it.
        This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
    \subparagraph{Versatile (V)}
        This weapon can be used with one or two hands.
        A damage value in parentheses appears with the property --- the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
\subsection*{Improvised Weapons} \label{ssec::improvisedweapons}
    Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand.
    An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead creature.

    Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such.
    For example, a table leg is akin to a club.
    At the DM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use their proficiency bonus with that weapon.

    An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object).
    If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage.
    An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 4 meters and a long range of 12 meters.
\subsection*{Weapon List} \label{ssec::weaponlist}
    \paragraph{+1/+2/+3 Weapon}
        You have a +1/+2/+3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
    \paragraph{Backbiting Spear $\odot$}
        This spear's handle sports an intricate and impossible-looking design.
        When you throw it, it deals one extra die of damage on a hit.
        After you throw it and it hits or misses, it flies back to your hand immediately.

        Whenever you roll a 1 on an thrown attack roll using this weapon, the weapon bends or flies to hit you in the back.
        Make a new attack roll with advantage against your own AC.
        If the result is a hit, you take damage as if you had attacked yourself with the spear.
    \paragraph{Beast Slayer}
        When you hit a beast with this weapon, the beast takes an extra 3d6 damage of the weapon's type.
        For the purpose of this weapon, ``beast'' refers to any creature with the beast type.
    \paragraph{Berserker Axe $\odot$}
        While you are attuned to this weapon, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.

        Whenever a hostile creature damages you while the axe is in your possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk.
        While berserk, you must use your actions each round to attack the creature nearest to you with the axe, moving to attack the next nearest creature after you fell your current target.
        If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random.
        You are berserk until you start your turn with no creatures within 12 meters of you that you can see or hear.
    \paragraph{Blacksaw $\odot$}
        This dagger has a saw-toothed edge and a black pearl nested in its pommel.
        A creature attuned to it gains blindsight out to a range of 6 meters.
    \paragraph{Blood Spear $\odot$}
        When you hit with a melee attack using this spear and reduce the target to 0 hit points, you gain 2d6 temporary hit points.
    \paragraph{Bloodaxe $\odot$}
        This axe is forged from a dark, rust-colored metal originally designed for the barbarian Grog Strongjaw.

        This greataxe deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to creatures that aren't constructs.
        If you reduce such a creature to 0 hit points with an attack using this axe, you gain 10 temporary hit points.
    \paragraph{Bomb}
        As an action, a character can light this bomb and throw it at a point up to 4/12 meters away.
        Each creature within 1 meter of that point must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 fire damage.
    \paragraph{Composite Bow}
        Instead of your Dexterity bonus, you add your Strength bonus to ranged attack and damage rolls made with a composite bow.
    \paragraph{Corpse Slayer}
        This special crossbow or firearm uses a peculiar mechanism to heat up its ammunition up while firing it.
        When you hit a fiend with an attack using this weapon, the attack deals an extra 1d8 damage of the weapon's type, and the creature has disadvantage on saving throws until the start of your next turn.
    \paragraph{Crusader's Sword $\odot$}
        This shortsword's design shows a purpose to fight evil.
        The sword has the following properties:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The sword continually sheds bright light in a 3-meter radius and dim light for an additional 3 meters.
            Only by destroying the sword can this light be extinguished.
            \item While attuned to the weapon, the sword's wielder can activate an aura of boldness.
            For one minute, this sword awakens boldness in every friendly creature within 6 meters of you.
            While in this aura, each of these creatures (including you) deals an extra 1d4 radiant damage when it hits with a weapon attack.
            Once used, this property of the sword can't be used again until the next dawn.
        \end{itemize}
    \paragraph{Dancing Sword $\odot$}
        You can use an action to toss this magic sword into the air and speak the command word.
        When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies up to 6 meters, and attacks one creature of your choice within 1 meter of it.
        The sword uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls.

        While the sword hovers, you can use an action to cause it to fly up to 6 meters to another spot within 6 meters of you.
        As part of the same action, you can cause the sword to attack one creature within 1 meter of it.

        After a minute or when you call it as a free action, the sword flies up to 6 meters and tries to return to your hand.
        If you have no hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet.
        If the sword has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground.
        It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 6 meters away from it.
    \paragraph{Defender $\odot$}
        The first time you attack with this sword on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the sword's bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn.

        Additionally, this attack is unaffected by the multiple attack penalty and doesn't add to it.
    \paragraph{Duskcrusher $\odot$}
        This item takes the form of a leather-wrapped wooden rod emblazoned with the symbol of Heliod, god of the sun.

        The warhammer's radiant head emits bright light in a 3-meter radius and dim light for an additional 3 meters.
        The light is sunlight.
        You can use an action to make the radiant head disappear.

        While the radiant head is active, you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, and attacks with the weapon deal radiant damage instead of bludgeoning damage.
        A fiend hit by the weapon takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.

        \end{itemize}

        If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the pick tears its life force from its body (a construct is immune to this effect).
        The pick loses 1 charge if the creature is slain.
        When the pick has no charges remaining, it loses this property.
    \paragraph{Repeater}
        This light crossbow is fitted with a cartridge that can hold up to six crossbow bolts.
        It automatically reloads after firing until the cartridge runs out of ammunition.
        Reloading the cartridge takes an action.
    \paragraph{Lightning Javelin}
        When you hurl this javelin and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 1 meter wide that extends out from you to a target within 24 meters.
        Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one.

        A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success.
        Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.
        You can only make one attack with a net per turn.

        When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.

        You must have seen the target before, but you don't need to see it now.
        If the target isn't within range or if there is no clear path to it, the dart falls to the ground, destroyed and wasted.
        Otherwise, winds guide the dart instantly through the air to the target.

        On a hit, the boomerang deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage and 3d4 thunder damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.
        On a miss, the boomerang returns to the thrower's hand.

        You can't infuse an arrow to explode again until you finish a short rest.
    \paragraph{Sword of Wounding $\odot$}

            \item \textbf{Disheartening Strike}.
            When you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can fill the target with unsettling dread: the target has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.

        It also can't take reactions.
        For its action it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.
