    \paragraph{Boggart Boots}
        While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on moving silently.
    \paragraph{Boots of False Tracks}
        By using two actions to adjust the soles, you can adjust the size and shape of your tracks to make them look like those of a wild animal.
    \paragraph{Boots of Speed $\odot$}
        While you wear these boots, you can use an action and click the boots' heels together.
        If you do, the boots double your walking speed, and any creature that makes an opportunity attack against you has disadvantage on the attack roll.
        If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.

        When the boots' property has been used for a total of 10 minutes, the boots ceases to function until you finish a short rest.
    \paragraph{Boots of Springing $\odot$}
        While you wear these boots, your walking speed becomes 6 meters, unless your walking speed is higher, and your speed isn't reduced if you are encumbered or wearing heavy armor.
        In addition, you can jump three times the normal distance, though you can't jump farther than your remaining movement would allow.
    \paragraph{Brooch of Shielding $\odot$}
        While wearing this brooch, you have resistance against force damage.
    \paragraph{Eyes of Charming $\odot$}
        These crystal lenses fit over the eyes.
        They have 3 charges.
        While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the charm person spell (see page \pageref{spell::charmperson}) with a save DC of 13 on a humanoid within 6 meters of you, provided that you and the target can see each other.
        The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.
    \paragraph{Eyes of Minute Seeing}
        These crystal lenses fit over the eyes.
        While wearing them, you can see much better than normal out to a range of 30 cm.
        You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on sight while searching an area or studying an object within that range.
    \paragraph{Eyes of the Eagle $\odot$}
        These crystal lenses fit over the eyes.
        While wearing them, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
        In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 60 cm. across.
    \paragraph{Warm Clothing}
        This outfit consists of a heavy fur coat or cloak over layers of wool clothing, as well as a fur-lined hat or hood, goggles, and fur-lined leather boots and gloves.

        As long as this clothing remains dry, its wearer automatically succeeds on saving throws against the effects of extreme cold.
    \paragraph{Winter Boots $\odot$}
        These furred boots are snug and feel quite warm.
        While you wear them, you gain the following benefits:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item You have resistance to cold damage.
            \item You ignore difficult terrain created by ice or snow.
            \item You can tolerate temperatures as low as -50 degrees Celsius without any additional protection.
            If you wear heavy clothes, you can tolerate temperatures as low as -70 degrees Celsius.
        \end{itemize}
