    \paragraph{Eyes of Charming $\odot$}
        These crystal lenses fit over the eyes.
        They have 3 charges.
        While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the charm person spell (see page \pageref{spell::charmperson}) with a save DC of 13 on a humanoid within 6 meters of you, provided that you and the target can see each other.
        The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.
