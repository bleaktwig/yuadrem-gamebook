\section{Materials and Labor} \label{sec::materialsandlabor}
    Any item in Yuadrem that can be bought can be crafted as well by a suficiently skilled artisan.
    Just like items, materials are separated by rarity, with increased rarity having increased cost.
    In addition, the labor required to craft rarer items is naturally harder, and thus is more expensive.
    This relation is shown in the Materials and Labor Costs table.

    Different items require a different number of materials.
    In addition to their final cost, items listed in the following sections also show the required number of materials needed to craft them, and the relevant set of artisan's tools needed to craft them.

    % NOTE. Maybe I'll add this. Maybe I won't. IDK yet.
    % Due to their scarcity in the world, some items require materials more expensive than what is common for their rarity.
    % These are marked by an $\ast$ symbol, and their material price is specified in their description.

    \begin{DndTable}[width=\linewidth, header=Materials and Labor Costs]{llll}
        \textbf{Rarity} & \textbf{Material Price} & \textbf{Labor Price} \\
