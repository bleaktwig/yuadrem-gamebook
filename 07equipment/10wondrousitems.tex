    \paragraph{Crystal Ball $\odot$}
        Made by wandering zaloths, this item is infused with their strange magic.

        This crystal ball is about 15 centimeters in diameter.
        While touching it, you can cast the scrying spell (see page \pageref{spell::scrying}) with save DC 17 with it.
    \paragraph{Crystalline Chronicle $\odot$}
        Made by wandering zaloths, this item is infused with their strange magic.
        You can only attune to this item if you have taken the spellcaster feat (page \pageref{feat::spellcaster}).

        An etched crystal sphere the size of a grapefruit hums faintly and pulses with irregular flares of inner light.
        The crystal contains the following spells: detect thoughts (see page \pageref{spell::detectthoughts}), intellect fortress (see page \pageref{spell::intellectfortress}), Rary's telepathic bond (see page \pageref{spell::rarystelepathicbond}), sending (see page \pageref{spell::sending}), telekinesis (see page \pageref{spell::telekinesis}), Tasha's mind whip (see page \pageref{spell::tashasmindwhip}), and Tenser's floating disk (see page \pageref{spell::tensersfloatingdisc}).
        While attuned to this item you know all these spells, and your knowledge of them fades when you end your attunement with it.

        While you are holding the crystal, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for these spells, and you know the mage hand (see page \pageref{spell::magehand}), mind sliver (see page \pageref{spell::mindsliver}), and message (see page \pageref{spell::message}) cantrips if you don't already know them.

        The crystal has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
        You can use the charges to cast a spell given by this item without verbal, somatic, or material components of up to 100 agnomas.
    \paragraph{Crystal Ball of Mind Reading $\odot$}
        Made by wandering zaloths, this item is infused with their strange magic.

        This crystal ball is about 15 centimeters in diameter.
        While touching it, you can cast the scrying spell (see page \pageref{spell::scrying}) with save DC 17 with it.

        You can use an action to cast the detect thoughts spell (see page \pageref{spell::detectthoughts}) with a save DC of 17 while you are scrying with the crystal ball, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor.
        You don't need to concentrate on this detect thoughts to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if scrying ends.
    \paragraph{Crystal Ball of Telepathy $\odot$}
        Made by wandering zaloths, this item is infused with their strange magic.

        This crystal ball is about 15 centimeters in diameter.
        While touching it, you can cast the scrying spell (see page \pageref{spell::scrying}) with save DC 17 with it.

        While scrying with the crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 6 meters of the spell's sensor.
        You can also use an action to cast the suggestion spell (see page \pageref{spell::suggestion}) with save DC 17 through the sensor on one of those creatures.
        You don't need to concentrate on this suggestion to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if scrying ends.
        Once used, the suggestion power of the crystal ball can't be used again until the next dawn.
    \paragraph{Crystal Ball of True Seeing $\odot$}
        Made by wandering zaloths, this item is infused with their strange magic.

        This crystal ball is about 15 centimeters in diameter.
        While touching it, you can cast the scrying spell (see page \pageref{spell::scrying}) with save DC 17 with it.

        While scrying with the crystal ball, you have truesight with a radius of 24 meters centered on the spell's sensor.
    \paragraph{Decanter of Endless Water}
        This decanter can contain up to 8 liters of water, which is compressed to extreme lengths when inside.
        Upon being opened, a 6-meter long geyser gushes forth from the decanter.
        As an action while holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser at a creature you can see within 6 meters of you.
        The target must succed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone.
        Instead of a creature, you can target an object that isn't being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 100 kg.
        The object is either knocked over or pushed up to 3 meters away from you.

        To use this ability the decanter must be filled with water, a process that takes half a minute.
    \paragraph{Eversmoking Bottle}
        Smoke leaks from the lead-stoppered mouth of this glass bottle, which weighs 0.5 kg.
        When you use two actions to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke pours out in a 12-meter radius from the bottle.
        The cloud's area is heavily obscured.
        Each minute the bottle remains open and within the cloud, the radius increases by 2 meters until it reaches its maximum radius of 24 meters.

        The cloud persists as long as the bottle is open.
        Closing the bottle requires an action.
        Once the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes.
        A moderate wind can also disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong wind can do so after 1 round.
    \paragraph{Folding Boat}
        This object appears as a wooden box that measures 30 cm long, 15 cm wide, and 15 cm deep.
        It weighs 2 kilograms and floats.
        It can be opened to store items inside.

        Using two actions, the box can be unfolded into a boat 3 meters long, 1 meter wide, and 60 cm deep.
        The boat has one pair of oars, a mast, and a lateen sail.
        The boat can hold up to four Medium creatures comfortably.

        Using two actions, the folding boat can fold back into a box, provided that no creatures are aboard.
    \paragraph{Fiend Sensor}
        This small ruby glows slightly when it is within 24 meters of a fiend.
    \paragraph{Figurine of Wondrous Power}
        This figurin is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket.
        If you use an action to throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 12 meters of you, the figurine becomes a living creature.
        If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.

        The creature is friendly to you and your companions.
        It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands.
        If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.

        The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine.
        At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form.
        It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it.
        When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a week has passed.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Bronze Griffon}.
            This bronze statuette is of a griffon rampant.
            It can become a griffon for up to 6 hours.
            \item \textbf{Golden Lions}.
            These gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs.
            You can use one figurine or both simultaneously.
            Each can become a lion for up to 1 hour.
            \item \textbf{Ivory Goats}.
            These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three.
            Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others.
            Their properties are as follows:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The goat of traveling can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse.
                It lasts for 24 hours.
                \item The goat of travail becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours.
                Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.
                \item The goat of terror becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours.
                The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons.
                One horn becomes a +1 lance, and the other becomes a +2 longsword.
                Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form.

                In addition, the goat radiates a 6-meter-radius aura of terror while you are riding it.
                Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form.
                The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours.
                Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Onyx Dog}.
            This onyx statuette of a dog can become a mastiff for up to 6 hours.
            The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8.
            The dog has darkvision out to a range of 12 meters and can see invisible creatures and objects within that range.
            \item \textbf{Silver Raven}.
            This silver statuette of a raven can become a raven for up to 12 hours.
            While in raven form, you can attach a letter to the raven's leg and tell it a location you know within 12 hours of travel, and the raven will go there to relay the message.
        \end{itemize}
    \paragraph{Frithling Glass Home} % TODO. Base frithlings in Chwingas.
        This colored glass bottle weights 0.5 kg.
        The bottle can serve as a comfortable home for up to 8 frithlings (see page \pageref{creature::frithling}) as long as the frithlings get along with each other.
        The frithlings are thankful towards you for giving them a home and taking them in your adventures, and can perform tasks asked by you within their ability, and will ocassionally give you favors or gifts for your friendship.
        The frithlings need to eat and drink, each consuming 1/8th of the rations and doses of water that a normal-sized humanoid needs.

        If you fail to provide the frithlings basic needs or constantly put them in danger they will abandon you, usually without warning.
    \paragraph{Gem of Brightness}
        This blue gem sheds bright light in a 6-meter radius and dim light for an additional 6 meters.
    \paragraph{Gem of Seeing}
        This gem is attached to a short wooden pole.
        While peering through the gem, you gain truesight out to a range of 24 meters.
    \paragraph{Goggles of Night}
        While wearing these dark lenses, you have darkvision out to a range of 12 meters.
        If you already have darkvision, wearing the goggles increases its range by 12 meters.
    \paragraph{Horseshoes of Speed}
        These iron horseshoes come in a set of four.
        While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they increase the creature's walking speed by 6 meters.
    \paragraph{Jamming Shackles}
        You can use an action to place these shackles on an incapacitated creature.
        The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size.
        In addition to serving as mundane manacles, the shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence.

        You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an action to remove them.
        Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check.
        On a success, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.
    \paragraph{Kruphix Stone $\odot\odot$}
        Many types of Kruphix stones exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color.

        When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 30 centimeters and confers a benefit to you.
        Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.
        You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.

        A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage.
        It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.

        Attuning to a Kruphix stone requires two attunement slots.
        You can carry any number of Kruphix stones using the same attunement slots.
        You cannot attune to more than one Kruphix stone of the same type at once.

        Rare Kruphix stones:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Awareness}.
            You can't be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.
            \item \textbf{Protection}.
            You gain a +1 bonus to AC while this dusty rose prism orbits your head.
            \item \textbf{Reserve}.
            While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it.
            The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell.
            The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.
            \item \textbf{Sustenance}.
            As long as this clear spindle spends at least 4 hours under direct, unobstructed sunlight, you don't need to eat or drink while it orbits your head.
        \end{itemize}

        Very rare Kruphix stones:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Absorption}.
            While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.

            Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic.
            If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.
            \item \textbf{Agility}.
            Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22, while this deep red sphere orbits your head.
            \item \textbf{Fortitude}.
            Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.
            \item \textbf{Insight}.
            Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.
            \item \textbf{Intellect}.
            Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head.
            \item \textbf{Leadership}.
            Your Charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head.
            \item \textbf{Might}.
            Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.
        \end{itemize}

        Legendary Kruphix stones:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Greater Absorption}.
            While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.

            Once the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic.
            If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.
            \item \textbf{Proficiency}.
            Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head.
            \item \textbf{Regeneration}.
            You regain 5 hit points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.
        \end{itemize}
    \paragraph{Manual of Bodily Health}
        This book contains health and diet tips from all around the world.

        A creature can benefit from this manual only once in its life.
    \paragraph{Manual of Gainful Exercise}
        This book describes fitness exercises from the harshest mountains of the north.

        A creature can benefit from this manual only once in its life.
    \paragraph{Manual of Golems}
        This tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a golem.
        To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least 60 spell points.
        A creature that can't use a manual of golems and attempts to read it takes 6d6 psychic damage.

        To create a golem, you must spend 10 long rests working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day.
        You must also pay 50,000 agnomas to purchase supplies.
        The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on it.
        It is under your control, and it understands and obeys your spoken commands.

    \paragraph{Pearl of Nightfall $\odot$}
        Used to summon night, this 15-centimeter-diameter, jet-black orb is cold to the touch.
        You can spend 10 minutes to activate it, causing the area within 15 kilometer of it at the moment of activation to become night even if it is daytime.
        This night lasts for 24 hours, until you cancel it as an action, or until your attunement to the pearl ends.
        Once used, the pearl can't be used again for 24 hours.
    \paragraph{Pharika's Ointment}
        This glass jar, 7 centimeters in diameter, contains 5 doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe.

        Taking up one minute, one dose of the ointment can be swallowed or applied to the skin.
        The creature that receives it regains 2d8 + 2 hit points and ceases to be poisoned.
    \paragraph{Shard of Nuagal}
        The origins of these shards are unknown, and only a master glassblower can evoke the following effects from it.

        While holding this shard, you can use an action to activate it.
        The shard then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to an island in Nuagal, the blue moon.
        The island is a tranquil garden, and contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors.

        For each hour spent in the island, a visitor regains hit points as if it had spent 1 hit die.
        Visitors remain in the island for up to 6 days.

        When the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the shard, or an unoccupied space nearest that location.
        The shard loses its power when it is used in this way.
    \paragraph{Sovereign Glue} \label{item::sovereignglue}
        This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects.
        It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with oil of slipperiness (see page \pageref{item::oilofslipperiness}).
        A container contains 7 uses.

        One use of the glue can cover a 50 centimeters square surface.
        The glue takes 1 minute to set.
        Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of universal solvent (see page \pageref{item::universalsolvent}).

    \paragraph{Stone of Ill Luck $\odot$}
        This polished agate appears to be a stone of good luck to anyone who tries to identify it, and it confers that item's property while on your person.

        The DM secretly applies this penalty, assuming you are adding the item's bonus.
