    \paragraph{Bowl of Commanding Water}
        While this bowl is filled with water, you can use two action to speak the bowl's command word and summon a water elemental, as if you had cast the conjure elemental spell (see page \pageref{spell::conjureelemental}), requiring concentration.
        The bowl can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

        The bowl is about 30 centimeters in diameter and half as deep.
        It weighs 1.5 kg. and holds about 12 liters.
    \paragraph{Censer of Controlling Air}
        While incense is burning in this censer, you can use two actions to speak the censer's command word and summon an air elemental, as if you had cast the conjure elemental spell (see page \pageref{spell::conjureelemental}), requiring concentration.
        The censer can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

        This 15-centimeter-wide, 30-centimeter-high vessel resembles a chalice with a decorated lid.
        It weighs 0.5 kg.
    \paragraph{Crystal Ball $\odot$}
        Made by wandering zaloths, this item is infused with their strange magic.

        This crystal ball is about 15 centimeters in diameter.
        While touching it, you can cast the scrying spell (see page \pageref{spell::scrying}) with save DC 17 with it.
    \paragraph{Crystalline Chronicle $\odot$}
        Made by wandering zaloths, this item is infused with their strange magic.
        You can only attune to this item if you have taken the spellcaster feat (page \pageref{feat::spellcaster}).

        An etched crystal sphere the size of a grapefruit hums faintly and pulses with irregular flares of inner light.
        The crystal contains the following spells: detect thoughts (see page \pageref{spell::detectthoughts}), intellect fortress (see page \pageref{spell::intellectfortress}), Rary's telepathic bond (see page \pageref{spell::rarystelepathicbond}), sending (see page \pageref{spell::sending}), telekinesis (see page \pageref{spell::telekinesis}), Tasha's mind whip (see page \pageref{spell::tashasmindwhip}), and Tenser's floating disk (see page \pageref{spell::tensersfloatingdisc}).
        While attuned to this item you know all these spells, and your knowledge of them fades when you end your attunement with it.

        While you are holding the crystal, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for these spells, and you know the mage hand (see page \pageref{spell::magehand}), mind sliver (see page \pageref{spell::mindsliver}), and message (see page \pageref{spell::message}) cantrips if you don't already know them.

        The crystal has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
        You can use the charges to cast a spell given by this item without verbal, somatic, or material components of up to 100 agnomas.
    \paragraph{Crystal Ball of Mind Reading $\odot$}
        Made by wandering zaloths, this item is infused with their strange magic.

        This crystal ball is about 15 centimeters in diameter.
        While touching it, you can cast the scrying spell (see page \pageref{spell::scrying}) with save DC 17 with it.

        You can use an action to cast the detect thoughts spell (see page \pageref{spell::detectthoughts}) with a save DC of 17 while you are scrying with the crystal ball, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor.
        You don't need to concentrate on this detect thoughts to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if scrying ends.
    \paragraph{Crystal Ball of Telepathy $\odot$}
        Made by wandering zaloths, this item is infused with their strange magic.

        This crystal ball is about 15 centimeters in diameter.
        While touching it, you can cast the scrying spell (see page \pageref{spell::scrying}) with save DC 17 with it.

        While scrying with the crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 6 meters of the spell's sensor.
        You can also use an action to cast the suggestion spell (see page \pageref{spell::suggestion}) with save DC 17 through the sensor on one of those creatures.
        You don't need to concentrate on this suggestion to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if scrying ends.
        Once used, the suggestion power of the crystal ball can't be used again until the next dawn.
    \paragraph{Crystal Ball of True Seeing $\odot$}
        Made by wandering zaloths, this item is infused with their strange magic.

        This crystal ball is about 15 centimeters in diameter.
        While touching it, you can cast the scrying spell (see page \pageref{spell::scrying}) with save DC 17 with it.

        While scrying with the crystal ball, you have truesight with a radius of 24 meters centered on the spell's sensor.
    \paragraph{Decanter of Endless Water}
        This decanter can contain up to 8 liters of water, which is compressed to extreme lengths when inside.
        Upon being opened, a 6-meter long geyser gushes forth from the decanter.
        As an action while holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser at a creature you can see within 6 meters of you.
        The target must succed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone.
        Instead of a creature, you can target an object that isn't being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 100 kg.
        The object is either knocked over or pushed up to 3 meters away from you.

        To use this ability the decanter must be filled with water, a process that takes half a minute.
    \paragraph{Eversmoking Bottle}
        Smoke leaks from the lead-stoppered mouth of this glass bottle, which weighs 0.5 kg.
        When you use two actions to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke pours out in a 12-meter radius from the bottle.
        The cloud's area is heavily obscured.
        Each minute the bottle remains open and within the cloud, the radius increases by 2 meters until it reaches its maximum radius of 24 meters.

        The cloud persists as long as the bottle is open.
        Closing the bottle requires an action.
        Once the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes.
        A moderate wind can also disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong wind can do so after 1 round.
    \paragraph{Frithling Glass Home} % TODO. Base frithlings in Chwingas.
        This colored glass bottle weights 0.5 kg.
        The bottle can serve as a comfortable home for up to 8 frithlings (see page \pageref{creature::frithling}) as long as the frithlings get along with each other.
        The frithlings are thankful towards you for giving them a home and taking them in your adventures, and can perform tasks asked by you within their ability, and will ocassionally give you favors or gifts for your friendship.
        The frithlings need to eat and drink, each consuming 1/8th of the rations and doses of water that a normal-sized humanoid needs.

        If you fail to provide the frithlings basic needs or constantly put them in danger they will abandon you, usually without warning.
    \paragraph{Goggles of Night}
        While wearing these dark lenses, you have darkvision out to a range of 12 meters.
        If you already have darkvision, wearing the goggles increases its range by 12 meters.
    \paragraph{Shard of Nuagal}
        The origins of these shards are unknown, and only a master glassblower can evoke the following effects from it.

        While holding this shard, you can use an action to activate it.
        The shard then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to an island in Nuagal, the blue moon.
        The island is a tranquil garden, and contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors.

        For each hour spent in the island, a visitor regains hit points as if it had spent 1 hit die.
        Visitors remain in the island for up to 6 days.

        When the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the shard, or an unoccupied space nearest that location.
        The shard loses its power when it is used in this way.
