\chapter{Spellcasting} \label{ch::spellcasting}
There exist five spellcasting doctrines in Yuadrem, each related to a tide.
Many schools belong to each doctrine, but all are related at heart.

\subparagraph{Sympathy} % red tide, fire, explode
    Born from the red tide, this doctrine focuses on the redirection of energy.
    Sympathy spellcasters usually carry a source of flame or heat at hand to cast spells, but the medium for this varies from school to school.
    % SCHOOLS: Queish, Eljur, !Flamespeaking

\subparagraph{Eldremry} % indigo tide, earth, cross
    Born from the indigo tide, Eldremry focuses on reshaping earth itself.
    Spells from this doctrine were used by Hairuus to create their island cities, but all traces of it were lost along with the nation.
    % SCHOOLS: Shazdrala, Mevthan, Geomancy

\subparagraph{Sigaldry} % silver tide, metal, split
    Born from the silver tide, this doctrine focuses on evoking effects from written words and special symbols.
    Sigaldry spells are highly sought after by blacksmiths, as runes from this doctrine are known to infuse strong effects on metal objects.
    % SCHOOLS: Guentsue

\subparagraph{Alchemy} % blue tide, water, drill
    Born of the blue tide, this doctrine focuses on manipulating the energy contained in each living being.
    Some schools focus on bringing out potent effects from food and drinks, while others enhance or impair a creature's ability directly.
    % SCHOOLS: Qerestad, Cthai'khas (fleshshaping), warchanting

\subparagraph{Thaumaturgy} % gold tide, wood, crush
    Born from the gold tide, this doctrine focuses on the power of words, both spoken and written.
    Thaumaturges use the power of their own voice to issue irresistible commands or veil one's eyes with insurmountable illusions.
    % SCHOOLS: Dremshamad (Written contracts and stuff), The Voice, Mephetis' thaumaturgy

% TODO. Missing spellcasting doctrines:
% Uldammy (white tide, wind, void) - focuses on changing the wind (like dentrala), lack of stuff (like Darkness) and shit.
% Rashid - manipulates the connection between tides and bringing in the essence of them.
% NOTE: The spellcasting focus for Rhashid and any tidal magic is your qualar.
% NOTE. PHARIKA SHIT. All weapons have some poison in them. Critical hits gain a damage bonus equal to double your Wisdom modifier.

% TODO: ! Thaumaturgy spellcasting school.
% TODO: ! Tortle alchemy-like chemistry, based on cooking to enhance effect of drugs and potions.
% TODO: ! Poison and alchemy stuff from followers of Pharika.
% TODO: ! Warchanting - using drugs and rituals to enhance rage in the name of Mogis.
    % Rage burns a spell point each turn while its activated, and other effects can use more spell points.
    % Rage has all the normal effects from the barbarian class.
    % lv 2: burn one additional spell point to gain one action during your turn.
    % lv 3: burn two spell points to ignore the multiple attack penalty while raging.

    % Bloodhorn Minotaurs
    % Named for their blood-caked horns, the Bloodhorn minotaurs have ragged claws to supplement their charges and gores. Gleeful in their brutality, they slaughter and devour any intruders they encounter in the badlands, and particularly value the bone marrow of young humans. They take pride in their overlarge, razor-sharp horns.

    % Felhide Minotaurs
    % The notoriously dour Felhide minotaurs are descended from the warlord Thyrogog of the Ashlands. The Theriad recounts the brute's defeat and the loss of his great axe, Goremaster. Viewing Thyrogog's defeat as a divine sign, the warlord's descendants retreated into the Ashlands.

    % Burial rites among the Felhide minotaurs involve devouring those who fell in battle, to remove their shame from memory and fuel the survivors' revenge. Should another scavenger reach a fallen Felhide before the rest of the band can eat the dead minotaur's remains, the minotaurs mobilize to track down as much of their dead comrade's body as possible.

    % Ragegore Minotaurs
    % Ragegore minotaurs are the most ferocious of their kind, deeply infected by the bloodlust of Mogis. Ragegores never withdraw from a battle, entering a frenzy of furious delight at the sight of an enemy's blood. While in the heat of battle, a Ragegore minotaur seems to feel no pain and barely notices wounds that would kill a human. Some Ragegores have been known to fall dead immediately at the cessation of battle, their life sustained only by their fury.
