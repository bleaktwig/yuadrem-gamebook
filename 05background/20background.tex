\section{Background} \label{sec::background}
% NOTE. Consider giving PCs the possibility of learning feats from other background, with the restriction that it needs one additional FP. This plays into the dynamism in Yuadrem.
Due to the open-endedness of characters in Yuadrem (see page \pageref{sec::classlessdnd} for more details), small changes are applied to the backgrounds in the official books.
Apart from providing a set of competences, equipment and an initial unique trait, each background has set of associated feats that can be learned at higher levels.

To choose religions and learned languages, refer to their respective sections in pages \pageref{ssec::religions} and \pageref{ssec::languages}.
These are not complete lists by any means, but rather the most common in the civilized world.
You are welcome to talk with your DM about including religions and languages as they may seem fit in your campaign.

For personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws, check the official books.

\subsection*{Acolyte} \label{ssec::acolyte}

    You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine.

    Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other divine being, and work with your DM to detail the nature of your religious service.
    This god or pantheon may be from any religion as detailed in the religion section (see pages \pageref{ssec::therism} for Therism and \pageref{ssec::religions} for other common religions), or a deity from outside of these pantheons that works with your DM.

    Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites?
    Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way?
    Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.

    Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities.
    Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals.

    \subparagraph{Competences} Religion, plus your choice of two from among History, Performance, Persuasion, and a language of your choice.

        You can do this in any established temple, improvised altar, or public plaza, and can expect to at least gather the attention of those around you.

        If you spend at least an hour performing this activity, you can choose to roll a Charisma (Performance) check contested against a target's --- or targets' --- Wisdom (Insight).
        On a success, they are charmed by you for 1d4 hours.
        This charm ends if you or one of your companions harms the creature.

        Additionally, you might receive a small donation for your performance at the DM's discretion.
