\section{Background}
Due to the open-endedness of characters in Yuadrem (see page \pageref{sec::classlessdnd} for more details), backgrounds as they are defined in the official D\&D5e books are not compatible with this book.
An alternative is proposed, where your character's background complements their kin, giving them a unique feat, and benefits when learning feats related to their background.

To choose religions and learned languages, refer to their respective sections in pages \pageref{ssec::religions} and \pageref{ssec::languages}.
These are not complete lists by any means, but rather the most common in the civilized world. %, and you are welcome to talk with your DM about including religions and languages as they may seem fit in your campaign.

% For your character's background, you can choose any from some of the official D\&D5e books which fit best with your character.
% The specific books from which you are welcome to pick a background are Acquisitions Incorporated, Ghosts of Saltmarsh, the Player's Handbook, Mythic Odysseys of Theros, and Tomb of Annihilation.

% The only change you need to apply is to convert any initial money to the local currency of the region where you're playing.
% To do this, convert the GP to the local currency using the currencies table in page \pageref{sec::currency} using the selling value.
