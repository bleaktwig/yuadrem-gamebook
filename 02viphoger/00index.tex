\chapter{Viphoger} \label{ch::viphoger}
\DndDropCapLine{A}{s a new nation, Viphoger is small. Its}
populated lands insignificant in size when compared to the unexplored wilderness beyond.

Viphoger consists of a peninsula forming the south-western edge of the vast Whaler's Sea.
South from the sea, the land rises up to a ridge of mountains.
The lofty peaks of this ridge forms a barrier that few cross, so only rumors of the vast Dead Sea describe the land beyond.

To the west, the coastal lands become small pockets of forests crossed by a labyrinth of arid canyons, with the Zoedrem desert beyond.

The Siren's inlet to the north is studded with islands large and small.
The largest cluster near the mainland, called the Dakra Isles, is poorly charted, and even those sailors who attempt to explore the isles return with contradictory information.
Eastward from Viphoger, the old nations of Yuadrem protect their lands, dominated by the strong influence of the Seven Kingdoms of the Sea.

The heart of Viphoger lies in and around three poleisâ€”cities and their surrounding territories.
Together the three poleis, Akhosh, Mephetis, and Setesh, encompass most of the population of Viphoger.
Mephetis covers the whole territory of the northeastern peninsula, Akhosh forms the frontier to the desert, and Setesh lies at the northern edge of the wild Nessian Wood.

The bands of the Uqhardu, the Vahagha, and the Pheres, roam the hills and badlands between the three poleis.
Remnants of the once great empire of Hulnar, now reduced to thieves and bandits.
The mysterious leonin hunt in the valley of Oreskos, nestled between Mt. Kure and Winter's Heart.
Bughna gats and marsets dwell around the Stola Vale and the larger Nessian Wood.
And tortles live primarily in the coastal shallows of the Siren Inlet, though some manage to make comfortable homes among the gats of Mephetis.

The canyon of Katajthon, south of Akhosh, is the frontier where Akhoshian soldiers clash with Treb gats.
Farther south-wwest is the Treb city of Kofos, little known to Viphogerians.

The necropoleis of Asphodel and Odunos are home to the Returned --- zombie-like beings who have contracted the Illness.
Access to these lands is strictly forbidden, and is punishable by death in all three poleis.
The lands around these cities are bleak and barren, as if the Returned brought the pall of the underworld out with them into the mortal realm.
