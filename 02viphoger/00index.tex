Viphoger consists of a peninsula forming the south-western edge of the vast Whaler's Sea.
South from the sea, the land rises up to a ridge of mountains.
The lofty peaks of this ridge forms a barrier that few cross, so only rumors of the vast Dead Sea describe the land beyond.

To the west, the coastal lands become small pockets of forests crossed by a labyrinth of arid canyons, with the Zoedrem desert beyond.

The Siren's Inlet to the north is studded with islands large and small.
The largest cluster near the mainland, called the Dakra Isles, is poorly charted, and even those sailors who attempt to explore the isles return with contradictory information.
Eastward from Viphoger, the old nations of Yuadrem trade in the Whaler's Sea. % , regulated by the strong influence of the Seven Kingdoms of the Sea.

The heart of Viphoger lies in and around three poleisâ€”cities and their surrounding territories.
Together the three poleis, Akhosh, Mephetis, and Setesh, encompass most of the population of Viphoger.
Mephetis covers the whole territory of the northeastern peninsula, Akhosh forms the frontier to the desert, and Setesh lies at the northern edge of the wild Nessian Wood.

The bands of the Uqhardu, the Vahagha, and the Pheres, roam the hills and badlands between the three poleis.
Remnants of the once great empire of Hulnar, now reduced to bandits and traders.
The mysterious leonin hunt in the valley of Oreskos, nestled between Mt. Kure and Winter's Heart.
Bughna gats and marsets dwell around the Stola Vale and the larger Nessian Wood.
And tortles live primarily in the coastal shallows of the Siren Inlet, though some manage to make comfortable homes among the gats of Mephetis.

The canyon of Katajthon, south of Akhosh, is the frontier where Akhoash soldiers clash with Treb gats.
Farther south-west is the city of Kofos, little known to Viphogerians.

The necropoleis of Asphodel and Odunos are home to the Returned --- zombie-like beings who have contracted the Illness.
Access to these lands is strictly forbidden, and is punishable by death in all three poleis.
The lands around these cities are bleak and barren, as if the Returned brought the pall of the underworld out with them into the mortal realm.

% TODO: ADD THESE AT SOME POINT.
% --- HULNAR REMNANTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection*{Pheres Lands}
%     Between the cliffs of Akhosh and the vast grasslands of Oreskos to the south, Pheres-band dratl irds roam across the dry, hilly landscape.
%     Gathered in small bands of fierce raiders, the Pheres irds plunder whatever prey they can find: merchants and other travelers moving between Akhosh and Setesh, settlers trying to eke out an existence in the region, leonin tribes, Vahagha-band irds who range too far to the south, and any others they encounter.

% \section*{Vahagha Grounds}
%     Between Mephetis and Setesh, along the shores of the Lindus River, roam the dratl irds of the Vahagha band.
%     Unlike the ferocious Pheres band, the Vahagha-band irds are generally peaceful and don't engage in raids upon Mephetian territory.
%     They are frequent visitors in Listes, Krinnos, and Mephetis itself, and often carry goods between Mephetis and Setesh, since they are more at home in the Nessian Wood than most Mephetian merchants.

% --- MYTHS ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection*{Myth of the Akhoash War}
%     Barely a year after the end of the Sylvan War, the Hulnar empire summoned the whole host of loyal spears from the house of Tadnas to wage war on the fortified canyon polis.
%
%     What followed was a siege that stretched on for decades.
%     Whole parts of Akhosh were destroyed and rebuilt in the fighting.
%     There were heroes who knew only a life of conflict, performing feats of incredible prowess for the honor of Olantin, or who awed the gods with their sleepless commitment to defending the gates of Akhosh.
%
%     Most people today know of the event from an embellished account laid down in an epic poem, The Akhoash War.
%     Authored by the great poet Vefan, the poem is considered to be a definitive accounting of the greatest war in history.
%     Countless soldiers aspire to fight with the honor and purpose that inspired the heroes of the Akhoash War.

% \subsection*{Myth of the Fall of Agnomakhos}
%     From the back of their mighty brontotherium, the et Agnomakhos led armies across the face of Viphoger, carving out an empire that stood for generations.
%     While numerous rebellions attempted to cast off the et's rule, each was crushed by their armies of cyclops, leonin, and other fearsome creatures.
%     So, when the heroes Kynaios and Tiro sought to inspire an uprising, few flocked to their banner.
%
%     Undeterred, the rebels soldiered on against impossible odds.
%     Seeing their dedication to the cause of freedom, the goddess Ephara came to the heroes.
%     She offered to aid Kynaios and Tiro in their battle against the tyrant, supplementing their martial skill with a new weapon: thaumaturgy.
%
%     With their new power, Kynaios and Tiro inspired the people to rise up against Agnomakhos, ultimately defeating their armies and striking the et down.
%     From their victory rose the polis of Mephetis and the use of thaumaturgy among mortals.
%
%     Agnomakhos's fall remains a point of honor in the minds of Mephetis's people, a moment immortalized in relief upon countless civic buildings throughout the polis.
