\section{Therism} \label{ssec::therism}

A pantheon of fifteen gods guides religious life on Viphoger.
From the sun and agriculture to death and passage into the Underworld, the gods oversee the forces of nature and the most important aspects of mortal life.
These gods are quite real to the people of Viphoger, who see them moving across the sky at night and sometimes encounter them face to face.
Thus, most people perform rituals and devotions that honor various gods, hoping to win their favor and stave off their wrath.
They tell and retell the stories of the gods' deeds --- even as they watch those stories continue to play out in the vastness of the night sky.

Therism is the main religion practiced in Viphoger.
While both religions draw from the same pantheon, Tanethism and Therism couldn't have less in common.
The former was designed by a scholar and forced on their by a king, while the latter developed gradually from the gat settlers of the Sylvan Canyon.

In their new land, they saw the gods' visage in the sky, equatting them to their ancient deities.
Not every mortal serves or acknowledges the gods, though.
Some philosophers in the schools of Mephetis teach that the gods of the pantheon are subordinate to a higher reality, perhaps the sky itself.
And other people, particularly leonin, believe that the gods are undeserving of mortal reverence.

Considering their significance to the people of Viphoger, this section includes a list of the 15 gods of the Therist pantheon, including a short description of each.
