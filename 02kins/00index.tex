\chapter{Kins}
% Guidelines:
% * At least one page of information should be provided for the kin.
% * Every kin should have at least one illustration to provide visual aid for the player.
% * Every kin must have 7 traits in total.
%   * At least one must be something unique and interesting to the kin (not necessarily useful).
%   * Some kin may have less if they have an extremely good trait (like the ird with a flying speed of 15 meters).
%   * At least one should bring a detriment along with their benefits.
%   * No trait should be purely detrimental.
%   * Some subraces can have detrimental features, but they're countered by good stuff.
% * Kins generally shouldn't lean to one particular playstyle, but this isn't always avoidable.
% * Some description of civilizations related to a certain kin is allowed, but shouldn't be the main focus.

modern kins were born, the ets were born into the land of Yuadrem.
% They were named by the other kins, their creations, due to their impressive size.
They were commonly known as the tall kin, for they usually stood well beyond 3 meters.
Their skin was of a pallid, almost bluish white color, and their eyes were as black as the abyss.
% Most ets didn't have any hair.

The species greatly developed their technology, which was biological in nature.
Free from aging and illness, they developed astonishing physical capabilities despite their apparent frailty.
Each et was indeed capable of shaping their own flesh, causing a great variety of characteristics in the many members of the kin.

Ets were obsessed with their individuality, and it was common for them to change their own appearance, molding their flesh to reflect their personality and philosophy.
Despite their longevity however, it was rare for new ets to be born, and the kin never grew to more than a few thousand members.

\subsubsection{Schools of Thought}
Their longing for longevity led them to study the cosmos, trying to find meaning in the stars.
These studies manifested in the form of the schools of thought, large organizations representing different ways of thinking about the cosmos and oneself.
These schools were their main form of government.%, where individuals were represented by their schools.

Among these organizations, the church of E'ukarilth was of special significance.
More than a thousand years ago, an event known as the first communion took place.
During a pilgrimage to the dead sea, the et E'ukarilth found the deceased embryo of a species yet unknown to its kin, which the tall one dubbed ``the higher kin''.

In an attempt to understand this newfound race, the tall one fused their body with that of the higher one.
The ritual was successful, but it transformed E'ukarilth to an insane, shapeless blob.
Later, the church of E'ukarilth was born to attempt communication with the mad et.

As the gospel of E'ukarilth spread, the kin became convinced that they were utterly insignificant to the cosmos.
The fear caused by this thought elevated their pursuit of individuality.
They believed that the higher kin held a method to become significant, and their schools of thought shifted their studies to focus solely on this strange species.
They believed that with this study they would attain something they called ``the rapture'', described as an ascension to a higher plane of existence.

Their unwavering pursuance eventually led to the schism.
The schism is the most devastating event in Yuadrem's history, causing a 40 year long famine and scarring the land itself for the centuries to come.

\subsubsection{Language}
The tall kin spoke a very sophisticated language, known as jan-theth rlin, simplified as jantherlin.
This language allowed for a very profound expression of one's emotions and inner state, and is still used in poetry to this date.
For when deeper communication is needed, ets could meld their bodies and share thought, but the practice was only used in special rituals or to express especially complex abstract concepts.

As for written word, it was customary for the tall kin to chisel the stone, commonly carving a great variety of images alongside the text.
While this written language originates from jantherlin, each tall one had its own personal version of it.
Other ets could only comprehend one's writing as much as they understood the writer.
This makes the study of jantherlin extremely difficult to modern archaeologists.
% This makes the reading of the jantherlin extremely difficult for the kin that remain in the world, since understanding a particular tall one's scribbles essentially requires understanding their own version of the language.

% \subsubsection{Relationships}
% Either by accident or by conscious decision, the tall kin created many of the modern peoples in experiments and studies.
% Most of these held a very high regard for the ets, with some even building entire churches to them.
% However, after it was learned that the they were responsible for the schism, all churches were forcibly shut down, and any adoration is severely punished.

% TODO: CHECK gats, irds, marsets, and oths and see that any trait that could be considered a technique actually is one, adding it to that list (and padding more text to account for the lost space.
% TODO: I should add an abstract image related to the tide color of each kin as background, which would enhance the relevance of the tides.
