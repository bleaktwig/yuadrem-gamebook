\textit{into our world by an unnatural pull, ever unable to find stable footing.
No matter how much they beg and cry, do not allow them into your home.
Touched by a strange flame, whose brightness attracts equally as strange beasts into your door, into your hearth.
Get rid of them before they share their misfortune with you.}

\hspace*{\fill} --- Abneh, renowned nimrod.

Brought into this world with the Schism, the nomad kin are a strange race from the outer lands.
Also known as umans, they have almost hairless bodies, and are similar in appearance to apes.

For an unknown reason, umans attract all kinds of predators from these lands.
Additionally, their blood has similar properties to the tall ones', and is used in many rituals.
Because of these reasons, umans are dispersed all around the world, and are nomadic in nature.

\subsection*{A Broad Spectrum}
Hunted by all kinds of kin and creatures, the nomad kin are forced to perpetually migrate and adapt to different environments, making them more physically diverse than the common kins.

There is no typical uman, with an individual standing from 1.5 meters to a little over 1.8 meters tall, and weighing from 60 to 125 kgs.
Acclimating to even the most extreme environments, a uman's skin shades to any color from the darkest brown to the lightest hues.
They also grow long hair in their scalps and faces, sporting a great variety of colors and thickness.
Nomads reach adulthood at around 14, and rarely live a single century.

Umans are a gendered kin, and usually have one child at a time.
Families consist of a father, a mother, and their kid or children, but it is not uncommon for other members of the nomadic groups to care for parentless children.

\subsection*{Accursed Coldblood}
Known as coldblood due to its cerulean tint, Umans' blood has special properties, and is very useful for spellcasters.
It retains a sort of energy, and can be used as a source of spells.
Umans know this, and regularly prepare blood vials for trade and to strengthen troupes' wizards.

Umans pay dearly for this special blood, as it acts as a beacon for the predators from the outer lands, the coldblood beasts.
These creatures hunt umans, and many of the kin are banned from villages for safety concerns.

Spellcasters seek coldblood, and many try to attain it by any means available.
Naturally, the murder of umans for their blood is illegal in most nations, but some carry the custom on nevertheless.
The nimrods are a cult that specializes in gathering coldblood via any means available, and are commonly contracted by wizards and warlocks to attain the product.

\subsection*{Adaptable and Durable}
Hunted by both beast and kin, umans have trouble trusting others and don't normally settle in communities of other kins.
They live in troupes exclusive to their kin, where usually all members have some familiar relationship.
Troupes travel together and care for each other, assigning specific roles to each member based on their skills.

Far from vulnerable, most troupes are fierce and resilient, hardened by centuries of being preyed upon.
Groups keep track of how they are treated by different cities and towns, and only do commerce where they are accepted.

While uncommon, some uman communities have managed to settle in one place.
These communities keep their locations secret, communicating it only to other umans via traveller's cant, a set of writings and symbols they brought from the outer lands.

\subsection*{Life in Escapade}
For a uman, a life of adventure is not a romantic desire but rather a fact of mundane life.
Used to the hardships of survival, a uman is especially capable of fending off threats and surpassing hardships.

It is very common to see lone uman adventurers, either as exiles or in a quest for their troupe.
Whatever the motive, they naturally excel at voyages, and are a great fit on any adventuring party.

\subsection*{Uman Names}
Umans most commonly wear names from other cultures.
Even in the outer lands, umans were known to have a great variety of names depending on each specific culture.
Those who desire to conserve their roots choose old names from their history and legends to give their children.
