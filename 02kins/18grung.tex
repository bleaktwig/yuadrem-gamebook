Also known as grungs, the poison kin are aggressive creatures that look similar to dart frogs.
The species quickly settled into the chirping wilds and the areas surrounding the rainforest after their arrival during the schism.
They are fiercely territorial and see themselves as superior to most other creatures.

\subsection*{Class Structure}
Grung society is a caste system.
Each caste lays eggs in a separate hatching pool, and juvenile grungs join their caste upon emergence from their hatchery.
All grungs are a dull greenish gray when they are born, but each individual takes on the color of its caste as it grows to adulthood.
From lowest to highest caste, grungs are green, blue, purple, red, orange, and gold.

Green grungs are the tribe's warriors, hunters, and laborers, and blue grungs work as artisans and in other domestic roles.
Supervising and guiding both groups are the purple grungs, which serve as administrators and commanders.
Red grungs are the tribe's scholars and sorcerers.
They are superior to purple, blue, and green grungs and given proper respect even by the grungs of higher status.
Higher castes include orange grungs, which are elite warriors that have authority over all lesser grungs, and gold grungs, which hold the highest leadership positions.
A tribe's sovereign is always a gold grung.

A grung normally remains in its caste for life.
On rare occasions, an individual that distinguishes itself with great deeds can earn an invitation to join a higher caste.
A mixture of godsblood, seawater and poison is blessed by a red grung, and by drinking it the elevated grung changes color and is inducted into its new caste in the same way that a juvenile of the caste would be.
From then on, the grung and its progeny are members of the higher caste.

\subsection*{Poisonous Skin}
All grungs secrete a substance that is harmless to them but poisonous to other creatures.
A grung can also use this secretion as venom to coat its weapons.
Grungs are always on the lookout for creatures they can capture and enslave, and use slaves for all manner of menial tasks and hard labor.
Slaves are fed mildly poisoned food to keep them lethargic and compliant.
A creature afflicted in this way over a long period of time becomes a shell of its former self, and it seldom can be restored to normalcy.
Being amphibious, grungs require water to live; any grung that fails to immerse itself in water for at least 1 hour during a day becomes quite exhausted.

\subsection*{Whistle Stick}
All grungs are trained to use a musical instrument called the whistle-stick.
This is a hollow wooden tube with holes cut throughout, much like a flute.
Grungs play music with it for entertainment, but can also swing it about by a sturdy cord to create a sound recognizable by others of their kin, so they know each other's approximate location.
Additionally, any creature that can speak the krehlo language can use a whistle stick in this manner to communicate over distance.

\subsection*{Outcast or Voyager}
Since social advancement among grungs can only be achieved by a great deed, it is not unusual for a grung or a small group of them to travel around the coasts and rivers of Yuadrem.
They attempt to obtain renown by murdering an enemy of their civilization, or by bringing a rare artifact or important strategic information.

While a rare occurrence, sometimes an individual grung or even entire family-lines can grow disillusioned by the hardships of class advancements.
Some of them decide to escape from their cities, leading lives of their own as independent colonies or as members of the rare cities or towns willing to accept them.
Individuals from these groups are known to follow a life of adventure to help their communities or simply to satiate an internal need for excitement in the grung's heart.

\subsection*{Grung Names}
Grungs usually have simple, non-gender-specific names with a strong consonant joined by a syllable with a glottal stop, but members of higher castes prefer longer, more elaborate names to reflect their status.
Their names don't actually come from the krelho language, but are made based on what's easier to pronounce for the grung.
Grungs also wear their city of origin as surname.
